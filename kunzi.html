<p>子曰：“学而时习之，不亦说乎？有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎？人不知而不愠，不亦君子乎？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application? Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters? Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?”</p>



<p>有子曰：“其为人也孝弟，而好犯上者，鲜矣；不好犯上而好作乱者，未之有也。君子务本，本立而道生。孝弟也者，其为仁之本与！”</p>



<p>The philosopher You said, “They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion. The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission! – are they not the root of all benevolent actions?”</p>



<p>子曰：“巧言令色，鲜矣仁！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.”</p>



<p>曾子曰：“吾日三省吾身：为人谋而不忠乎？与朋友交而不信乎？传不习乎？”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng said, “I daily examine myself on three points: whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful; whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere; whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.”</p>



<p>子曰：“道千乘之国，敬事而信，节用而爱人，使民以时。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.”</p>



<p>子曰：“弟子入则孝，出则弟，谨而信，泛爱众，而亲仁，行有余力，则以学文。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“贤贤易色；事父母，能竭其力；事君，能致其身；与朋友交，言而有信。虽曰未学，吾必谓之学矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere – although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子不重则不威，学则不固。主忠信，无友不如己者，过，则勿惮改。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid. Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.”</p>



<p>曾子曰：“慎终追远，民德归厚矣。”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng said, “Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice – then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.”</p>



<p>子禽问于子贡曰：“夫子至于是邦也，必闻其政，求之与，抑与之与？”子贡曰：“夫子温、良、恭、俭、让以得之。夫子之求之也，其诸异乎人之求之与？”</p>



<p>Zi Qin asked Zi Gong, saying, “When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?” Zi Gong said, “Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master’s mode of asking information! – is it not different from that of other men?”</p>



<p>子曰：“父在，观其志；父没，观其行；三年无改于父之道，可谓孝矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “While a man’s father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.”</p>



<p>有子曰：“礼之用，和为贵。先王之道，斯为美。小大由之，有所不行。知和而和，不以礼节之，亦不可行也。”</p>



<p>The philosopher You said, “In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them. Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.”</p>



<p>有子曰：“信近于义，言可复也。恭近于礼，远耻辱也。因不失其亲，亦可宗也。”</p>



<p>The philosopher You said, “When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子食无求饱，居无求安，敏于事而慎于言，就有道而正焉，可谓好学也已。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified – such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.”</p>



<p>子贡曰：“贫而无谄，富而无骄，何如？”子曰：“可也。未若贫而乐，富而好礼者也。”子贡曰：“《诗》云：‘如切如磋，如琢如磨’，其斯之谓与？”子曰：“赐也，始可与言《诗》已矣，告诸往而知来者。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong said, “What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?” The Master replied, “They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.” Zi Gong replied, “It is said in the Book of Poetry, ‘As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.’ – The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.” The Master said, “With one like Ci, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.”</p>



<p>子曰：“不患人之不己知，患不知人也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I will not be afflicted at men’s not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.”</p>

<div id="2. Wei Zheng (论语·为政)" class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>子曰：“为政以德，譬如北辰，居其所而众星共之。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.”</p>



<p>子曰：“《诗》三百，一言以蔽之，曰：‘思无邪’。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence – ‘Having no depraved thoughts.’”</p>



<p>子曰：“道之以政，齐之以刑，民免而无耻。道之以德，齐之以礼，有耻且格。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.”</p>



<p>子曰：“吾十有五而志于学，三十而立，四十而不惑，五十而知天命，六十而耳顺，七十而从心所欲，不逾矩。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. At thirty, I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven. At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.”</p>



<p>孟懿子问孝，子曰：“无违。”樊迟御，子告之曰：“孟孙问孝于我，我对曰‘无违’。”樊迟曰：“何谓也？”子曰：“生，事之以礼；死，葬之以礼，祭之以礼。”</p>



<p>Meng Yi asked what filial piety was. The Master said, “It is not being disobedient.” Soon after, as Fan Chi was driving him, the Master told him, saying, “Meng-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him, – ‘not being disobedient.’” Fan Chi said, “What did you mean?” The Master replied, “That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.”</p>



<p>孟武伯问孝。子曰：“父母唯其疾之忧。”</p>



<p>Meng Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, “Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick.”</p>



<p>子游问孝。子曰：“今之孝者，是谓能养。至于犬马，皆能有养；不敬，何以别乎？”</p>



<p>Zi You asked what filial piety was. The Master said, “The filial piety nowadays means the support of one’s parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support; – without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?”</p>



<p>子夏问孝。子曰：“色难。有事，弟子服其劳；有酒食，先生馔，曾是以为孝乎？”</p>



<p>Zi Xia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, “The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?”</p>



<p>子曰：“吾与回言终日，不违，如愚。退而省其私，亦足以发，回也不愚。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said – as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui! – He is not stupid.”</p>



<p>子曰：“视其所以，观其所由，察其所安，人焉廋哉？人焉廋哉？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “See what a man does. Mark his motives. Examine in what things he rests. How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?”</p>



<p>子曰：“温故而知新，可以为师矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子不器。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.”</p>



<p>子贡问君子。子曰：“先行其言而后从之。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, “He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子周而不比，小人比而不周。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.”</p>



<p>子曰：“学而不思则罔，思而不学则殆。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.”</p>



<p>子曰：“攻乎异端，斯害也已！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!”</p>



<p>子曰：“由，诲女知之乎！知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “You, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it – this is knowledge.”</p>



<p>子张学干禄。子曰：“多闻阙疑，慎言其余，则寡尤；多见阙殆，慎行其余，则寡悔。言寡尤，行寡悔，禄在其中矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang was learning with a view to official emolument. The Master said, “Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others – then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice – then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.”</p>



<p>哀公问曰：“何为则民服？”孔子对曰：“举直错诸枉，则民服；举枉错诸直，则民不服。”</p>



<p>The Duke Ai asked, saying, “What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?” Confucius replied, “Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.”</p>



<p>季康子问：“使民敬、忠以劝，如之何？”子曰：“临之以庄，则敬；孝慈，则忠；举善而教不能，则劝。”</p>



<p>Ji Kang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, “Let him preside over them with gravity; then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all; then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent; then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.”</p>



<p>或谓孔子曰：“子奚不为政？”子曰：“《书》云：‘孝乎惟孝，友于兄弟。’施于有政，是亦为政，奚其为为政？”</p>



<p>Some one addressed Confucius, saying, “Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?” The Master said, “What does the Shu Jing say of filial piety? – ‘You are filial, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.’ This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT – making one be in the government?”</p>



<p>子曰：“人而无信，不知其可也。大车无輗，小车无軏，其何以行之哉？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?”</p>



<p>子张问：“十世可知也？”子曰：“殷因于夏礼，所损益，可知也；周因于殷礼，所损益，可知也。其或继周者，虽百世，可知也。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known. Confucius said, “The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Xia; wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Zhou dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin; wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Zhou, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.”</p>



<p>子曰：“非其鬼而祭之，谄也；见义不为，无勇也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery. To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.”</p>
</div>

<div id="3. Ba Yi (论语·八佾)" class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>孔子谓季氏：“八佾舞于庭，是可忍也，孰不可忍也？”</p>



<p>Confucius said of the head of the Ji family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, “If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?”</p>



<p>三家者以《雍》彻，子曰：“‘相维辟公，天子穆穆’，奚取于三家之堂？”</p>



<p>The three families used the Yong ode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, “‘Assisting are the princes; the son of heaven looks profound and grave’ – what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?”</p>



<p>子曰：“人而不仁，如礼何？人而不仁，如乐何？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?”</p>



<p>林放问礼之本，子曰：“大哉问！礼，与其奢也，宁俭；丧，与其易也，宁戚。”</p>



<p>Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies. The Master said, “A great question indeed! In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than a minute attention to observances.”</p>



<p>子曰：“夷狄之有君，不如诸夏之亡也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them.”</p>



<p>季氏旅于泰山。子谓冉有曰：“女弗能救与？”对曰：“不能。”子曰：“呜呼！曾谓泰山不如林放乎？”</p>



<p>The chief of the Ji family was about to sacrifice to the Tai mountain. The Master said to Ran You, “Can you not save him from this?” He answered, “I cannot.” Confucius said, “Alas! will you say that the Tai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子无所争，必也射乎！揖让而升，下而饮。其争也君子。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Junzi.”</p>



<p>子夏问曰：“‘巧笑倩兮，美目盼兮，素以为绚兮’何谓也？”子曰：“绘事后素。”曰：“礼后乎？”子曰：“起予者商也，始可与言《诗》已矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia asked, saying, “What is the meaning of the passage – ‘The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?’” The Master said, “The business of laying on the colors follows (the preparation of) the plain ground.” “Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?” The Master said, “It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him.”</p>



<p>子曰：“夏礼吾能言之，杞不足征也；殷礼吾能言之，宋不足征也。文献不足故也，足则吾能征之矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I could describe the ceremonies of the Xia dynasty, but Qi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Song cannot sufficiently attest my words. (They cannot do so) because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words.”</p>



<p>子曰：“禘自既灌而往者，吾不欲观之矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.”</p>



<p>或问禘之说。子曰：“不知也。知其说者之于天下也，其如示诸斯乎！”指其掌。</p>



<p>Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, “I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this” – pointing to his palm.</p>



<p>祭如在，祭神如神在。子曰：“吾不与祭，如不祭。”</p>



<p>He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present. The Master said, “I consider my not being present at the sacrifice, as if I did not sacrifice.”</p>



<p>王孙贾问曰：“‘与其媚于奥，宁媚于灶’，何谓也？”子曰：“不然，获罪于天，无所祷也。”</p>



<p>Wang Sun Jia asked, saying, “What is the meaning of the saying, ‘It is better to pay court to the furnace than to the southwest corner?’” The Master said, “Not so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.”</p>



<p>子曰：“周监于二代，郁郁乎文哉！吾从周。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Zhou had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Zhou.”</p>



<p>子入太庙，每事问。或曰：“孰谓鄹人之子知礼乎？入太庙，每事问。”子闻之，曰：“是礼也。”</p>



<p>The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, “Who say that the son of the man of Zou knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.” The Master heard the remark, and said, “This is a rule of propriety.”</p>



<p>子曰：“射不主皮，为力不同科，古之道也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing – because people’s strength is not equal. This was the old way.”</p>



<p>子贡欲去告朔之饩羊，子曰：“赐也！尔爱其羊，我爱其礼。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month. The Master said, “Ci, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.”</p>



<p>子曰：“事君尽礼，人以为谄也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one’s prince is accounted by people to be flattery.”</p>



<p>定公问：“君使臣，臣事君，如之何？”孔子对曰：“君使臣以礼，臣事君以忠。”</p>

<p>The Master said, “Small indeed was the capacity of Guan Zhong!” Some one said, “Was Guan Zhong parsimonious?” “Guan,” was the reply, “had the San Gui, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?” “Then, did Guan Zhong know the rules of propriety?” The Master said, “The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Guan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Guan had also such a stand. If Guan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?”</p>

<p>子曰：“里仁为美，择不处仁，焉得知？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?”</p>

<p>The Master said, “Riches and honors are what men desire. If it cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If it cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided. If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfill the requirements of that name? The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.”</p>

<p>The Master said, “I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person. Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient. Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.”</p>



<p>子曰：“人之过也，各于其党。观过，斯知仁矣。”</p>

<p>The Master said, “In serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that they do not incline to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur.”</p>



<p>子曰：“父母在，不远游，游必有方。”</p>

<p>Some one said, “Yong is truly virtuous, but he is not ready with his tongue.” The Master said, “What is the good of being ready with the tongue?

<p>Meng Wu asked about Zi Lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous. The Master said, “I do not know.” He asked again, when the Master replied, “You, in a kingdom of a thousand chariots, might be employed to manage the military levies, but I do not know whether he be perfectly virtuous.” “And what do you say of Qiu?” The Master replied, “Qiu, in a city of a thousand families, or a clan of a hundred chariots, might be employed as governor, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.” “What do you say of Chi?” The Master replied, “Chi, with his sash girt and standing in a court, might be employed to converse with the visitors and guests, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.”</p>

How can he be pronounced perfectly virtuous?” Zi Zhang proceeded, “When the officer Cui killed the prince of Qi, Chen Wen, though he was the owner of forty horses, abandoned them and left the country. Coming to another state, he said, ‘They are here like our great officer, Cui,’ and left it. He came to a second state, and again said ‘They are here like our great officer, Cui,’ and left it also – what do you say of him?” The Master replied, “He was pure.” “Was he perfectly virtuous?” “I do not know. How can he be pronounced perfectly virtuous?”</p>

<p>The Master said, “Fine words, an insinuating appearance, and excessive respect – Zuo Qiu Ming was ashamed of them. I also am ashamed of them. To conceal resentment against a person, and appear friendly with him – Zuo Qiu Ming was ashamed of such conduct. I also am ashamed of it.”</p>

<p>The Master said, “Meng Zhi Fan does not boast of his merit. Being in the rear on an occasion of flight, when they were about to enter the gate, he whipped up his horse, saying, ‘It is not that I dare to be last. My horse would not advance.’”</p>



<p>子曰：“不有祝鮀之佞，而有宋朝之美，难乎免于今之世矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Without the specious speech of the litanist Tuo and the beauty of the prince Zhao of Song, it is difficult to escape in the present age.”</p>



<p>子曰：“谁能出不由户？何莫由斯道也？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Who can go out but by the door? How is it that men will not walk according to these ways?”</p>



<p>子曰：“质胜文则野，文胜质则史。文质彬彬，然后君子。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Where the solid qualities are in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the accomplishments are in excess of the solid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and solid qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue.”</p>



<p>子曰：“人之生也直，罔之生也幸而免。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Man is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his escape from death is the effect of mere good fortune.”</p>



<p>子曰：“知之者不如好之者，好之者不如乐之者。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight in it.”</p>



<p>子曰：“中人以上，可以语上也；中人以下，不可以语上也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “To those whose talents are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced. To those who are below mediocrity, the highest subjects may not be announced.”</p>



<p>樊迟问知，子曰：“务民之义，敬鬼神而远之，可谓知矣。”问仁，曰：“仁者先难而后获，可谓仁矣。”</p>



<p>Fan Chi asked what constituted wisdom. The Master said, “To give one’s self earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.” He asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, “The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent consideration – this may be called perfect virtue.”</p>



<p>子曰：“知者乐水，仁者乐山。知者动，仁者静。知者乐，仁者寿。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived.”</p>



<p>子曰：“齐一变至于鲁，鲁一变至于道。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Qi, by one change, would come to the State of Lu. Lu, by one change, would come to a State where true principles predominated.”</p>



<p>子曰：“觚不觚，觚哉！觚哉！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “A cornered vessel without corners – a strange cornered vessel! A strange cornered vessel!”</p>



<p>宰我问曰：“仁者，虽告之曰：‘井有仁焉。’其从之也？”子曰：“何为其然也？君子可逝也，不可陷也；可欺也，不可罔也。”</p>



<p>Zai Wo asked, saying, “A benevolent man, though it be told him, ‘There is a man in the well’ will go in after him, I suppose.” Confucius said, “Why should he do so? A superior man may be made to go to the well, but he cannot be made to go down into it. He may be imposed upon, but he cannot be fooled.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子博学于文，约之以礼，亦可以弗畔矣夫。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right.”</p>



<p>子见南子，子路不说，夫子矢之曰：“予所否者，天厌之！天厌之！”</p>



<p>The Master having visited Nan Zi, Zi Lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, “Wherein I have done improperly, may Heaven reject me! may Heaven reject me!”</p>



<p>子曰：“中庸之为德也，其至矣乎！民鲜久矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been its practice among the people.”</p>



<p>子贡曰：“如有博施于民而能济众，何如？可谓仁乎？”子曰：“何事于仁，必也圣乎！尧、舜其犹病诸！夫仁者，己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人。能近取譬，可谓仁之方也已。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong said, “Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?” The Master said, “Why speak only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this. Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others. To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves – this may be called the art of virtue.”</p>

<p>子曰：“述而不作，信而好古，窃比于我老彭。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with our old Peng.”</p>



<p>子曰：“默而识之，学而不厌，诲人不倦，何有于我哉？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The silent treasuring up of knowledge; learning without satiety; and instructing others without being wearied – which one of these things belongs to me?”</p>



<p>子曰：“德之不修，学之不讲，闻义不能徙，不善不能改，是吾忧也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The learning virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is not good – these are the things which occasion me solicitude.”</p>



<p>子之燕居，申申如也，夭夭如也。</p>



<p>When the Master was unoccupied with business, his manner was easy, and he looked pleased.</p>



<p>子曰：“甚矣吾衰也！久矣吾不复梦见周公。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Extreme is my decay. For a long time, I have not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of Zhou.”</p>



<p>子曰：“志于道，据于德，依于仁，游于艺。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Let the will be set on the path of duty. Let every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. Let perfect virtue be accorded with. Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.”</p>



<p>子曰：“自行束脩以上，吾未尝无诲焉。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any one.”</p>



<p>子曰：“不愤不启，不悱不发，举一隅不以三隅反，则不复也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.”</p>



<p>子食于有丧者之侧，未尝饱也。</p>



<p>When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to the full.</p>



<p>子于是日哭，则不歌。</p>



<p>On a day when the master had wept, he did not sing.</p>



<p>子谓颜渊曰：“用之则行，舍之则藏，惟我与尔有是夫！”子路曰：“子行三军，则谁与？”子曰：“暴虎冯河，死而无悔者，吾不与也。必也临事而惧，好谋而成者也。”</p>



<p>The Master said to Yan Yuan, “When called to office, to undertake its duties; when not so called, to lie retired – it is only I and you who have attained to this.” Zi Lu said, “If you had the conduct of the armies of a great state, whom would you have to act with you?” The Master said, “He who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without any regret, I would not have act with me. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.”</p>



<p>子曰：“富而可求也，虽执鞭之士，吾亦为之。如不可求，从吾所好。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which I love.”</p>



<p>子之所慎：斋，战，疾。</p>



<p>The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest caution were – fasting, war, and sickness.</p>



<p>子在齐闻《韶》，三月不知肉味，曰：“不图为乐之至於斯也。”</p>



<p>When the Master was in Qi, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. He said, “I did not think that music could have been made so excellent as this.”</p>



<p>冉有曰：“夫子为卫君乎？” 子贡曰：“诺，吾将问之。” 入，曰：“伯夷、叔齐何人也？”曰：“古之贤人也。”曰：“怨乎？”曰：“求仁而得仁，又何怨？” 出，曰：“夫子不为也。”</p>



<p>Ran You said, “Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?” Zi Gong said, “Oh! I will ask him.” He went in accordingly, and said, “What sort of men were Bo Yi and Shu Qi?” “They were ancient worthies,” said the Master. “Did they have any repinings because of their course?” The Master again replied, “They sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine about?” On this, Zi Gong went out and said, “Our Master is not for him.”</p>



<p>子曰：“饭疏食饮水，曲肱而枕之，乐亦在其中矣。不义而富且贵，于我如浮云。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow; I have still joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.”</p>



<p>子曰：“加我数年，五十以学《易》，可以无大过矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If some years were added to my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be without great faults.”</p>



<p>子所雅言，《诗》、《书》、执礼，皆雅言也。</p>



<p>The Master’s frequent themes of discourse were: the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequently discoursed.</p>



<p>叶公问孔子于子路，子路不对。子曰：“女奚不曰：其为人也，发愤忘食，乐以忘忧，不知老之将至云尔。”</p>



<p>The Duke of She asked Zi Lu about Confucius, and Zi Lu did not answer him. The Master said, “Why did you not say to him, ‘He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming on?’”</p>



<p>子曰：“我非生而知之者，好古，敏以求之者也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.”</p>



<p>子不语怪、力、乱、神。</p>



<p>The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were: extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings.</p>



<p>子曰：“三人行，必有我师焉。择其善者而从之，其不善者而改之。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.”</p>



<p>子曰：“天生德于予，桓魋其如予何？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Huan Tui – what can he do to me?”</p>



<p>子曰：“二三子以我为隐乎？吾无隐乎尔！吾无行而不与二三子者，是丘也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.”</p>



<p>子以四教：文，行，忠，信。</p>



<p>There were four things which the Master taught: letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.</p>



<p>子曰：“圣人，吾不得而见之矣；得见君子者斯可矣。”子曰：“善人，吾不得而见之矣，得见有恒者斯可矣。亡而为有，虚而为盈，约而为泰，难乎有恒矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.” The Master said, “A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me. Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease – it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.”</p>



<p>子钓而不纲，弋不射宿。</p>



<p>The Master angled, but did not use a net. He shot, but not at birds perching.</p>



<p>子曰：“盖有不知而作之者，我无是也。多闻，择其善者而从之；多见而识之，知之次也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory – this is the second style of knowledge.”</p>



<p>互乡难与言，童子见，门人惑。子曰：“与其进也，不与其退也，唯何甚？人洁己以进，与其洁也，不保其往也。”</p>



<p>It was difficult to talk (profitably and reputably) with the people of Hu Xiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the Master, the disciples doubted. The Master said, “I admit people’s approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct.”</p>



<p>子曰：“仁远乎哉？我欲仁，斯仁至矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.”</p>



<p>陈司败问：“昭公知礼乎？”孔子曰：“知礼。”孔子退，揖巫马期而进之，曰：“吾闻君子不党，君子亦党乎？君取于吴，为同姓，谓之吴孟子。君而知礼，孰不知礼？”巫马期以告，子曰：“丘也幸，苟有过，人必知之。”</p>



<p>The minister of crime of Chen asked whether the duke Zhao knew propriety, and Confucius said, “He knew propriety.” Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu Ma Qi to come forward, and said, “I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the house of Wu, of the same surname with himself, and called her, ‘The elder Zi of Wu.’ If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?” Wu Ma Qi reported these remarks, and the Master said, “I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them.”</p>



<p>子与人歌而善，必使反之，而后和之。</p>



<p>When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.</p>



<p>子曰：“文，莫吾犹人也。躬行君子，则吾未之有得。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.”</p>



<p>子曰：“若圣与仁，则吾岂敢？抑为之不厌，诲人不倦，则可谓云尔已矣。”公西华曰：“正唯弟子不能学也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The sage and the man of perfect virtue – how dare I rank myself with them? That I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness – this much can be said of me.” Gong Xi Hua said, “This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.”</p>



<p>子疾病，子路请祷。子曰：“有诸？”子路对曰：“有之。《诔》曰：‘祷尔于上下神祇。’”子曰：“丘之祷久矣。”</p>



<p>The Master being very sick, Zi Lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, “May such a thing be done?” Zi Lu replied, “It may. In the Eulogies it is said, ‘Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.’” The Master said, “My praying has been for a long time.”</p>



<p>子曰：“奢则不孙，俭则固。与其不孙也，宁固。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子坦荡荡，小人长戚戚。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.”</p>



<p>子温而厉，威而不猛，恭而安。</p>



<p>The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.</p>
</div>


<div id="8. Tai Bo (论语·泰伯)" class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>子曰：“泰伯，其可谓至德也已矣。三以天下让，民无得而称焉。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Tai Bo may be said to have reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.”</p>



<p>子曰：“恭而无礼则劳；慎而无礼则葸；勇而无礼则乱；直而无礼则绞。君子笃于亲，则民兴于仁；故旧不遗，则民不偷。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness. When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.”</p>



<p>曾子有疾，召门弟子曰：“启予足，启予手。《诗》云：‘战战兢兢，如临深渊，如履薄冰。’而今而后，吾知免夫，小子！”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, “Uncover my feet, uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, ‘We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, my little children.”</p>



<p>曾子有疾，孟敬子问之。曾子言曰：“鸟之将死，其鸣也哀；人之将死，其言也善。君子所贵乎道者三：动容貌，斯远暴慢矣；正颜色，斯近信矣；出辞气，斯远鄙倍矣。笾豆之事，则有司存。”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng being ill, Meng Jing went to ask how he was. Zeng said to him, “When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good. There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important: that in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.”</p>



<p>曾子曰：“以能问于不能；以多问于寡；有若无，实若虚，犯而不校。昔者吾友尝从事于斯矣。”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng said, “Gifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.”</p>



<p>曾子曰：“可以托六尺之孤，可以寄百里之命，临大节而不可夺也。君子人与？君子人也。”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng said, “Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles – is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.”</p>



<p>曾子曰：“士不可以不弘毅，任重而道远。仁以为己任，不亦重乎？死而后已，不亦远乎？”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng said, “The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long. Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain – is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop – is it not long?”</p>



<p>子曰：“兴于《诗》，立于礼，成于乐。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. It is from Music that the finish is received.”</p>



<p>子曰：“民可，使由之；不可，使知之。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.”</p>



<p>子曰：“好勇疾贫，乱也。人而不仁，疾之已甚，乱也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. The man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme, will also proceed to insubordination.”</p>



<p>子曰：“如有周公之才之美，使骄且吝，其余不足观也已。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the duke of Zhou, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.”</p>



<p>子曰：“三年学，不至于谷，不易得也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Having learned for three years without coming to be good – such a man is not easy to find.”</p>



<p>子曰：“笃信好学，守死善道。危邦不入，乱邦不居。天下有道则见，无道则隐。邦有道，贫且贱焉，耻也；邦无道，富且贵焉，耻也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course. Such a one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed. When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.”</p>



<p>子曰：“不在其位，不谋其政。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.”</p>



<p>子曰：“师挚之始，《关雎》之乱，洋洋乎盈耳哉！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When the music master Zhi first entered on his office, the finish of the Guan Ju was magnificent – how it filled the ears!”</p>



<p>子曰：“狂而不直，侗而不愿，悾悾而不信，吾不知之矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere – such persons I do not understand.”</p>



<p>子曰：“学如不及，犹恐失之。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Learn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose it.”</p>



<p>子曰：“巍巍乎！舜、禹之有天下也而不与焉。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them!”</p>



<p>子曰：“大哉尧之为君也！巍巍乎，唯天为大，唯尧则之。荡荡乎，民无能名焉。巍巍乎其有成功也，焕乎其有文章！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it. How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!”</p>



<p>舜有臣五人而天下治。武王曰：“予有乱臣十人。”孔子曰：“才难，不其然乎？唐虞之际，于斯为盛；有妇人焉，九人而已。三分天下有其二，以服事殷。周之德，其可谓至德也已矣。”</p>



<p>Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed. King Wu said, “I have ten able ministers.” Confucius said, “Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of Tang and Yu met, were they more abundant than in this of Zhou, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more than nine men. King Wen possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Zhou may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.”</p>



<p>子曰：“禹，吾无间然矣。菲饮食而致孝乎鬼神，恶衣服而致美乎黼冕，卑宫室而尽力乎沟洫。禹，吾无间然矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yü.”</p>

<p>子罕言利与命与仁。</p>



<p>The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were: profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue.</p>



<p>达巷党人曰：“大哉孔子！博学而无所成名。”子闻之，谓门弟子曰：“吾何执？执御乎，执射乎？吾执御矣。”</p>



<p>A man of the village of Da Xiang said, “Great indeed is the philosopher Kong! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.” The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, “What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.”</p>



<p>子曰：“麻冕，礼也；今也纯，俭，吾从众。拜下，礼也；今拜乎上，泰也；虽违众，吾从下。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice. Bowing below the hall is prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.”</p>



<p>子绝四：毋意、毋必、毋固、毋我。</p>



<p>There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.</p>



<p>子畏于匡，曰：“文王既没，文不在兹乎？天之将丧斯文也，后死者不得与于斯文也；天之未丧斯文也，匡人其如予何？”</p>



<p>The Master was put in fear in Kuang. He said, “After the death of King Wen, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me? If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal, should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of Kuang do to me?”</p>



<p>太宰问于子贡曰：“夫子圣者与，何其多能也？”子贡曰：“固天纵之将圣，又多能也。”子闻之，曰：“太宰知我乎？吾少也贱，故多能鄙事。君子多乎哉？不多也。”</p>



<p>A high officer asked Zi Gong, saying, “May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!” Zi Gong said, “Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.” The Master heard of the conversation and said, “Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and therefore I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability.”</p>



<p>牢曰：“子云：‘吾不试，故艺。’”</p>



<p>Lao said, “The Master said, ‘Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.’”</p>



<p>子曰：“吾有知乎哉？无知也。有鄙夫问于我，空空如也。我叩其两端而竭焉。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.”</p>



<p>子曰：“凤鸟不至，河不出图，吾已矣夫！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The Feng bird does not come; the river sends forth no map – it is all over with me!”</p>



<p>子见齐衰者、冕衣裳者与瞽者，见之，虽少，必作，过之必趋。</p>



<p>When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily.</p>



<p>颜渊喟然叹曰：“仰之弥高，钻之弥坚。瞻之在前，忽焉在后。夫子循循然善诱人，博我以文，约我以礼，欲罢不能。既竭吾才，如有所立卓尔，虽欲从之，末由也已。”</p>



<p>Yan Yuan, in admiration of the Master’s doctrines, sighed and said, “I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind. The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety. When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.”</p>



<p>子疾病，子路使门人为臣。病间，曰：“久矣哉，由之行诈也！无臣而为有臣，吾谁欺？欺天乎？且予与其死于臣之手也，无宁死于二三子之手乎！且予纵不得大葬，予死于道路乎？”</p>



<p>The Master being very ill, Zi Lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him. During a remission of his illness, he said, “Long has the conduct of You been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?”</p>



<p>子贡曰：“有美玉于斯，韫椟而藏诸？求善贾而沽诸？”子曰：“沽之哉，沽之哉！我待贾者也。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong said, “There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?” The Master said, “Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.”</p>



<p>子欲居九夷。或曰：“陋，如之何？”子曰：“君子居之，何陋之有！”</p>



<p>The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east. Some one said, “They are rude. How can you do such a thing?” The Master said, “If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?”</p>



<p>子曰：“吾自卫反鲁，然后乐正，《雅》《颂》各得其所。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.”</p>



<p>子曰：“出则事公卿，入则事父兄，丧事不敢不勉，不为酒困，何有于我哉？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one’s father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one’s self; and not to be overcome of wine – which one of these things do I attain to?”</p>



<p>子在川上曰：“逝者如斯夫！不舍昼夜。”</p>



<p>The Master standing by a stream, said, “It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!”</p>



<p>子曰：“吾未见好德如好色者也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.”</p>



<p>子曰：“譬如为山，未成一篑，止，吾止也；譬如平地，虽覆一篑，进，吾往也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it is my own going forward.”</p>



<p>子曰：“语之而不惰者，其回也与！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Never flagging when I set forth anything to him – ah! that is Hui.”</p>



<p>子谓颜渊，曰：“惜乎！吾见其进也，未见其止也。”</p>



<p>The Master said of Yan Yuan, “Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.”</p>



<p>子曰：“苗而不秀者有矣夫，秀而不实者有矣夫。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but no fruit is subsequently produced!”</p>



<p>子曰：“后生可畏，焉知来者之不如今也？四十、五十而无闻焉，斯亦不足畏也已。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.”</p>



<p>子曰：“法语之言，能无从乎？改之为贵。巽与之言，能无说乎？绎之为贵。说而不绎，从而不改，吾末如之何也已矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.”</p>



<p>子曰：“主忠信。毋友不如己者，过，则勿惮改。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.”</p>



<p>子曰：“三军可夺帅也，匹夫不可夺志也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.”</p>



<p>子曰：“衣敝缊袍，与衣狐貉者立而不耻者，其由也与！‘不忮不求，何用不臧？’”子路终身诵之，子曰：“是道也，何足以臧？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed – ah! it is You who is equal to this! He dislikes none, he covets nothing – what can he do but what is good!” Zi Lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, “Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.”</p>



<p>子曰：“岁寒，然后知松柏之后凋也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.”</p>



<p>子曰：“知者不惑，仁者不忧，勇者不惧。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.”</p>



<p>子曰：“可与共学，未可与适道；可与适道，未可与立；可与立，未可与权。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.”</p>



<p>“唐棣之华，偏其反而。岂不尔思？室是远尔。”子曰：“未之思也，夫何远之有。”</p>



<p>“How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.” The Master said, “It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?”</p>

<p>孔子于乡党，恂恂如也，似不能言者；其在宗庙朝庭，便便言，唯谨尔。</p>



<p>Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak. When he was in the prince’s ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.</p>



<p>朝，与下大夫言，侃侃如也；与上大夫言，訚訚如也。君在，踧踖如也，与与如也。</p>



<p>When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely. When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.</p>



<p>君召使摈，色勃如也，足躩如也。揖所与立，左右手，衣前后襜如也。趋进，翼如也。宾退，必复命曰：“宾不顾矣。”</p>



<p>When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty. He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted. He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird. When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, “The visitor is not turning round any more.”</p>



<p>入公门，鞠躬如也，如不容。立不中门，行不履阈。过位，色勃如也，足躩如也，其言似不足者。摄齐升堂，鞠躬如也，屏气似不息者。出，降一等，逞颜色，怡怡如也；没阶，趋进，翼如也；复其位，踧踖如也。</p>



<p>When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him. When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold. When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them. He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe. When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.</p>



<p>执圭，鞠躬如也，如不胜。上如揖，下如授。勃如战色，足蹜蹜如有循。享礼，有容色。私觌，愉愉如也。</p>



<p>When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the ground. In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance. At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.</p>



<p>君子不以绀緅饰，红紫不以为亵服。当暑袗絺绤，必表而出之。缁衣羔裘，素衣麑裘，黄衣狐裘。亵裘长，短右袂。必有寝衣，长一身有半。狐貉之厚以居。去丧，无所不佩。非帷裳，必杀之。羔裘玄冠不以吊。吉月，必朝服而朝。</p>



<p>The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress. Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color. In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. Over lamb’s fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn’s fur one of white; and over fox’s fur one of yellow. The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short. He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body. When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger. When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle. His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below. He did not wear lamb’s fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence. On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.</p>



<p>齐，必有明衣，布。齐必变食，居必迁坐。</p>



<p>When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth. When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment.</p>



<p>食不厌精，脍不厌细。食饐而餲，鱼馁而肉败，不食；色恶，不食；臭恶，不食；失饪，不食；不时，不食；割不正，不食；不得其酱，不食。肉虽多，不使胜食气。唯酒无量，不及乱。沽酒市脯，不食。不撤姜食，不多食。</p>



<p>He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small. He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in season. He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce. Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused by it. He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market. He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much. Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air.</p>



<p>祭于公，不宿肉。祭肉不出三日，出三日不食之矣。</p>



<p>When he had been assisting at the prince’s sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.</p>



<p>食不语，寝不言。</p>



<p>When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak.</p>



<p>虽疏食菜羹，瓜祭，必齐如也。</p>



<p>Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air.</p>



<p>席不正，不坐。</p>



<p>If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.</p>



<p>乡人饮酒，杖者出，斯出矣。乡人傩，朝服而立于阼阶。</p>



<p>When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he went out immediately after. When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps.</p>



<p>问人于他邦，再拜而送之。</p>



<p>When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away.</p>



<p>康子馈药，拜而受之。曰：“丘未达，不敢尝。”</p>



<p>Ji Kang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, “I do not know it. I dare not taste it.”</p>



<p>厩焚，子退朝，曰：“伤人乎？”不问马。</p>



<p>The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, “Has any man been hurt?” He did not ask about the horses.</p>



<p>君赐食，必正席先尝之；君赐腥，必熟而荐之；君赐生，必畜之。侍食于君，君祭，先饭。疾，君视之，东首，加朝服，拖绅。君命召，不俟驾行矣。</p>



<p>When the prince sent him a gift of cooked meat, he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive. When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything. When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle across them. When the prince’s order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.</p>



<p>入太庙，每事问。</p>



<p>When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.</p>



<p>朋友死，无所归，曰：“于我殡。” 朋友之馈，虽车马，非祭肉，不拜。</p>



<p>When any of his friends died, if he had no relations who could be depended on for the necessary offices, he would say, “I will bury him.” When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow. The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice.</p>



<p>寝不尸，居不容。见齐衰者，虽狎，必变。见冕者与瞽者，虽亵，必以貌。凶服者式之，式负版者。有盛馔，必变色而作。迅雷风烈，必变。</p>



<p>In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment. When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute him in a ceremonious manner. To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of population. When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up. On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance.</p>



<p>升车，必正立，执绥。车中不内顾，不疾言，不亲指。</p>



<p>When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord. When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands.</p>



<p>色斯举矣，翔而后集。曰：“山梁雌雉，时哉时哉！”子路共之，三嗅而作。</p>



<p>Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles. The Master said, “There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!” Zi Lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelled him and then rose.</p>

<p>子曰：“先进于礼乐，野人也；后进于礼乐，君子也。如用之，则吾从先进。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen. If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.”</p>



<p>子曰：“从我于陈、蔡者，皆不及门也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Of those who were with me in Chen and Cai, there are none to be found to enter my door.”</p>



<p>德行：颜渊，闵子骞，冉伯牛，仲弓。言语：宰我，子贡。政事：冉有，季路。文学：子游，子夏。</p>



<p>Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yan Yuan, Min Zi Qian, Ran Bo Niu, and Zhong Gong; for their ability in speech, Zai Wo and Zi Gong; for their administrative talents, Ran You and Ji Lu; for their literary acquirements, Zi You and Zi Xia.</p>



<p>子曰：“回也非助我者也，于吾言无所不说。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.”</p>



<p>子曰：“孝哉闵子骞！人不间于其父母昆弟之言。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Filial indeed is Min Zi Qian! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers.”</p>



<p>南容三复白圭，孔子以其兄之子妻之。</p>



<p>Nan Rong was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife.</p>



<p>季康子问：“弟子孰为好学？”孔子对曰：“有颜回者好学，不幸短命死矣，今也则亡。”</p>



<p>Ji Kang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, “There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.”</p>



<p>颜渊死，颜路请子之车以为之椁。子曰：“才不才，亦各言其子也。鲤也死，有棺而无椁，吾不徒行以为之椁。以吾从大夫之后，不可徒行也。”</p>



<p>When Yan Yuan died, Yan Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son’s coffin. The Master said, “Whether he has talents or has not talents, everyone calls his son his son. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.”</p>



<p>颜渊死。子曰：“噫！天丧予！天丧予！”</p>



<p>When Yan Yuan died, the Master said, “Alas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!”</p>



<p>颜渊死，子哭之恸，从者曰：“子恸矣！”曰：“有恸乎？非夫人之为恸而谁为？”</p>



<p>When Yan Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, “Master, your grief is excessive!” “Is it excessive?” said he. “If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?”</p>



<p>颜渊死，门人欲厚葬之，子曰：“不可。”门人厚葬之，子曰：“回也视予犹父也，予不得视犹子也。非我也，夫二三子也！”</p>



<p>When Yan Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, “You may not do so.” The disciples did bury him in great style. The Master said, “Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.”</p>



<p>季路问事鬼神，子曰：“未能事人，焉能事鬼？”曰：“敢问死。”曰：“未知生，焉知死？”</p>



<p>Ji Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, “While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?” Ji Lu added, “I venture to ask about death?” He was answered, “While you do not know life, how can you know about death?”</p>



<p>闵子侍侧，訚訚如也；子路，行行如也；冉有、子贡，侃侃如也。子乐。“若由也，不得其死然。”</p>



<p>The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Zi Lu, looking bold and soldierly; Ran You and Zi Gong, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased. He said, “You there – he will not die a natural death.”</p>



<p>鲁人为长府，闵子骞曰：“仍旧贯如之何？何必改作？”子曰：“夫人不言，言必有中。”</p>



<p>Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury. Min Zi Qian said, “Suppose it were to be repaired after its old style; why must it be altered and made anew?” The Master said, “This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.”</p>



<p>子曰：“由之瑟奚为于丘之门？”门人不敬子路，子曰：“由也升堂矣，未入于室也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “What has the lute of You to do in my door?” The other disciples began not to respect Zi Lu. The Master said, “You has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner apartments.”</p>



<p>子贡问：“师与商也孰贤？”子曰：“师也过，商也不及。”曰：“然则师愈与？”子曰：“过犹不及。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong asked which of the two, Shi or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, “Shi goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.” “Then,” said Zi Gong, “the superiority is with Shi, I suppose.” The Master said, “To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.”</p>



<p>季氏富于周公，而求也为之聚敛而附益之。子曰：“非吾徒也，小子鸣鼓而攻之可也。”</p>



<p>The head of the Ji family was richer than the duke of Zhou had been, and yet Qiu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth. The Master said, “He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.”</p>



<p>柴也愚，参也鲁，师也辟，由也喭。</p>



<p>Chai is simple. Shen is dull. Shi is specious. You is coarse.</p>



<p>子曰：“回也其庶乎，屡空。赐不受命而货殖焉，亿则屡中。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want. Ci does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct.”</p>



<p>子张问善人之道，子曰：“不践迹，亦不入于室。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, “He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.”</p>



<p>子曰：“论笃是与，君子者乎，色庄者乎？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If, because a man’s discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?”</p>



<p>子路问：“闻斯行诸？”子曰：“有父兄在，如之何其闻斯行之？”冉有问：“闻斯行诸？”子曰：“闻斯行之。公西华曰：“由也问闻斯行诸，子曰‘有父兄在’；求也问闻斯行诸，子曰‘闻斯行之’赤也惑，敢问。”子曰：“求也退，故进之；由也兼人，故退之。”</p>



<p>Zi Lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, “There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted – why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?” Ran You asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, “Immediately carry into practice what you hear.” Gong Xi Hua said, “You asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, ‘There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.’ Qiu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, ‘Carry it immediately into practice.’ I, Chi, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.” The Master said, “Qiu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. You has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back.”</p>



<p>子畏于匡，颜渊后。子曰：“吾以女为死矣！”曰：“子在，回何敢死！”</p>



<p>The Master was put in fear in Kuang and Yan Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, “I thought you had died.” Hui replied, “While you were alive, how should I presume to die?”</p>



<p>季子然问：“仲由、冉求可谓大臣与？”子曰：“吾以子为异之问，曾由与求之问。所谓大臣者，以道事君，不可则止。今由与求也，可谓具臣矣。”曰：“然则从之者与？”子曰：“弑父与君，亦不从也。”</p>



<p>Ji Zi Ran asked whether Zhong You and Ran Qiu could be called great ministers. The Master said, “I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about You and Qiu! What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires. Now, as to You and Qiu, they may be called ordinary ministers.” Zi Ran said, “Then they will always follow their chief – will they?” The Master said, “In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.”</p>



<p>子路使子羔为费宰，子曰：“贼夫人之子。”子路曰：“有民人焉，有社稷焉，何必读书然后为学。”子曰：“是故恶夫佞者。”</p>



<p>Zi Lu got Zi Gao appointed governor of Fei. The Master said, “You are injuring a man’s son.” Zi Lu said, “There are (there) common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?” The Master said, “It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.”</p>



<p>子路、曾皙、冉有、公西华侍坐，子曰：“以吾一日长乎尔，毋吾以也。居则曰‘不吾知也’如或知尔，则何以哉？”子路率尔而对曰：“千乘之国，摄乎大国之间，加之以师旅，因之以饥馑，由也为之，比及三年，可使有勇，且知方也。”夫子哂之。“求，尔何如？”对曰：“方六七十，如五六十，求也为之，比及三年，可使足民。如其礼乐，以俟君子。”“赤！尔何如？”对曰：“非曰能之，愿学焉。宗庙之事，如会同，端章甫，愿为小相焉。”“点，尔何如？”鼓瑟希，铿尔，舍瑟而作，对曰：“异乎三子者之撰。”子曰：“何伤乎？亦各言其志也。”曰：“暮春者，春服既成，冠者五六人，童子六七人，浴乎沂，风乎舞雩，咏而归。”夫子喟然叹曰：“吾与点也！”三子者出，曾皙后。曾皙曰：“夫三子者之言何如？”子曰：“亦各言其志也已矣。”曰：“夫子何哂由也？”曰：“为国以礼，其言不让，是故哂之。”“唯求则非邦也与？”“安见方六七十、如五六十而非邦也者？”“唯赤则非邦也与？”“宗庙会同，非诸侯而何？赤也为之小，孰能为之大？”</p>



<p>Zi Lu, Zeng Xi, Ran You, and Gong Xi Hua were sitting by the Master. He said to them, “Though I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that. From day to day you are saying, ‘We are not known.’ If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?” Zi Lu hastily and lightly replied, “Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large states; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables – if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years’ time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.” The Master smiled at him. Turning to Ran You, he said, “Qiu, what are your wishes?” Qiu replied, “Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it – in three years’ time, I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to do that.” “What are your wishes, Chi,” said the Master next to Gong Xi Hua. Chi replied, “I do not say that my ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant.” Last of all, the Master asked Zeng Xi, “Dian, what are your wishes?” Dian, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and said, “My wishes are different from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen.” Said the Master, “What harm is there in that? Do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.” Dian then said, “In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the Yi, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.” The Master heaved a sigh and said, “I give my approval to Dian.” The three others having gone out, Zeng Xi remained behind, and said, “What do you think of the words of these three friends?” The Master replied, “They simply told each one his wishes.” Xi pursued, “Master, why did you smile at You?” He was answered, “The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him.” Xi again said, “But was it not a state which Qiu proposed for himself?” The reply was, “Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?” Once more, Xi inquired, “And was it not a state which Chi proposed for himself?” The Master again replied, “Yes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Chi were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great one?”</p>

<p>颜渊问仁，子曰：“克己复礼为仁。一日克己复礼，天下归仁焉。为仁由己，而由人乎哉？”颜渊曰：“请问其目？”子曰：“非礼勿视，非礼勿听，非礼勿言，非礼勿动。” 颜渊曰：“回虽不敏，请事斯语矣。”</p>



<p>Yan Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, “To subdue one’s self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?” Yan Yuan said, “I beg to ask the steps of that process.” The Master replied, “Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.” Yan Yuan then said, “Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.”</p>



<p>仲弓问仁，子曰：“出门如见大宾，使民如承大祭。己所不欲，勿施于人。在邦无怨，在家无怨。”仲弓曰：“雍虽不敏，请事斯语矣。”</p>



<p>Zhong Gong asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, “It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.” Zhong Gong said, “Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.”</p>



<p>司马牛问仁，子曰：“仁者，其言也讱。”曰：“其言也讱，斯谓之仁已乎？”子曰：“为之难，言之得无讱乎？”</p>



<p>Si Ma Niu asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, “The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.” Niu replied, “Cautious and slow in his speech! Is this what is meant by perfect virtue?” The Master said, “When a man feels the difficulty of doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?”</p>



<p>司马牛问君子，子曰：“君子不忧不惧。”曰：“不忧不惧，斯谓之君子已乎？”子曰：“内省不疚，夫何忧何惧？”</p>



<p>Si Ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, “The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.” Niu said, “Being without anxiety or fear! Does this constitute what we call the superior man?” The Master said, “When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?”</p>



<p>司马牛忧曰：“人皆有兄弟，我独亡。”子夏曰：“商闻之矣：死生有命，富贵在天。君子敬而无失，与人恭而有礼，四海之内皆兄弟也。君子何患乎无兄弟也？”</p>



<p>Si Ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, “Other men all have their brothers, I only have not.” Zi Xia said to him, “There is the following saying which I have heard – ‘Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors depend upon Heaven.’ Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety – then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?”</p>



<p>子张问明，子曰：“浸润之谮，肤受之愬，不行焉，可谓明也已矣；浸润之谮、肤受之愬不行焉，可谓远也已矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, “He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful, may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.”</p>



<p>子贡问政，子曰：“足食，足兵，民信之矣。”子贡曰：“必不得已而去，于斯三者何先？”曰：“去兵。”子贡曰：“必不得已而去，于斯二者何先？”曰：“去食。自古皆有死，民无信不立。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong asked about government. The Master said, “The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.” Zi Gong said, “If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?” “The military equipment,” said the Master. Zi Gong again asked, “If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?” The Master answered, “Part with the food. From of old, death has been the lot of all men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.”</p>



<p>棘子成曰：“君子质而已矣，何以文为？”子贡曰：“惜乎，夫子之说君子也！驷不及舌。文犹质也，质犹文也。虎豹之鞟犹犬羊之鞟。”</p>



<p>Ji Zi Cheng said, “In a superior man it is only the substantial qualities which are wanted; why should we seek for ornamental accomplishments?” Zi Gong said, “Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.”</p>



<p>哀公问于有若曰：“年饥，用不足，如之何？”有若对曰：“盍彻乎？”曰：“二，吾犹不足，如之何其彻也？”对曰：“百姓足，君孰与不足？百姓不足，君孰与足？”</p>



<p>The duke Ai inquired of You Ruo, saying, “The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient – what is to be done?” You Ruo replied to him, “Why not simply tithe the people?” The duke replied, “With two tenths I find it not enough – how could I do with that system of one tenth?” You Ruo answered, “If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.”</p>



<p>子张问崇德辨惑，子曰：“主忠信，徙义，崇德也。爱之欲其生，恶之欲其死；既欲其生又欲其死，是惑也。‘诚不以富，亦只以异。’”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, “Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right – this is the way to exalt one’s virtue. You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion. ‘It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.’”</p>



<p>齐景公问政于孔子，孔子对曰：“君君，臣臣，父父，子子。”公曰：“善哉！信如君不君、臣不臣、父不父、子不子，虽有粟，吾得而食诸？”</p>



<p>The duke Jing, of Qi, asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, “There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.” “Good!” said the duke; “if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the minister not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?”</p>



<p>子曰：“片言可以折狱者，其由也与？”子路无宿诺。</p>



<p>The Master said, “Ah! it is You, who could with half a word settle litigations!” Zi Lu never slept over a promise.</p>



<p>子曰：“听讼，吾犹人也。必也使无讼乎。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.”</p>



<p>子张问政，子曰：“居之无倦，行之以忠。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang asked about government. The Master said, “The art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.”</p>



<p>子曰：“博学于文，约之以礼，亦可以弗畔矣夫。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子成人之美，不成人之恶；小人反是。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.”</p>



<p>季康子问政于孔子，孔子对曰：“政者，正也。子帅以正，孰敢不正？”</p>



<p>Ji Kang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, “To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?”</p>



<p>季康子患盗，问于孔子。孔子对曰：“苟子之不欲，虽赏之不窃。”</p>



<p>Ji Kang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, “If you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.”</p>



<p>季康子问政于孔子曰：“如杀无道以就有道，何如？”孔子对曰：“子为政，焉用杀？子欲善而民善矣。君子之德风，小人之德草，草上之风必偃。”</p>



<p>Ji Kang asked Confucius about government, saying, “What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?” Confucius replied, “Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across it.”</p>



<p>子张问：“士何如斯可谓之达矣？”子曰：“何哉尔所谓达者？”子张对曰：“在邦必闻，在家必闻。”子曰：“是闻也，非达也。夫达也者，质直而好义，察言而观色，虑以下人。在邦必达，在家必达。夫闻也者，色取仁而行违，居之不疑。在邦必闻，在家必闻。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang asked, “What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?” The Master said, “What is it you call being distinguished?” Zi Zhang replied, “It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.” The Master said, “That is notoriety, not distinction. Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people’s words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan. As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.”</p>



<p>樊迟从游于舞雩之下，曰：“敢问崇德、修慝、辨惑。”子曰：“善哉问！先事后得，非崇德与？攻其恶，无攻人之恶，非修慝与？一朝之忿，忘其身，以及其亲，非惑与？”</p>



<p>Fan Chi rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, “I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.” The Master said, “Truly a good question! If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration – is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail one’s own wickedness and not assail that of others – is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning’s anger to disregard one’s own life, and involve that of his parents – is not this a case of delusion?”</p>



<p>樊迟问仁，子曰：“爱人。”问知，子曰：“知人。”樊迟未达，子曰：“举直错诸枉，能使枉者直。”樊迟退，见子夏，曰：“乡也吾见于夫子而问知，子曰：‘举直错诸枉，能使枉者直’，何谓也？”子夏曰：“富哉言乎！舜有天下，选于众，举皋陶，不仁者远矣。汤有天下，选于众，举伊尹，不仁者远矣。”</p>



<p>Fan Chi asked about benevolence. The Master said, “It is to love all men.” He asked about knowledge. The Master said, “It is to know all men.” Fan Chi did not immediately understand these answers. The Master said, “Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be upright.” Fan Chi retired, and, seeing Zi Xia, he said to him, “A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. He said, ‘Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked; in this way, the crooked will be made to be upright.’ What did he mean?” Zi Xia said, “Truly rich is his saying! Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Gao Yao, on which all who were devoid of virtue disappeared. Tang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Yi Yin, and all who were devoid of virtue disappeared.”</p>



<p>子贡问友，子曰：“忠告而善道之，不可则止，毋自辱焉。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong asked about friendship. The Master said, “Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable, stop. Do not disgrace yourself.”</p>



<p>曾子曰：“君子以文会友，以友辅仁。”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng said, “The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.”</p>

<p>子路问政，子曰：“先之，劳之。”请益，曰：“无倦。”</p>



<p>Zi Lu asked about government. The Master said, “Go before the people with your example, and be laborious in their affairs.” He requested further instruction, and was answered, “Be not weary (in these things).”</p>



<p>仲弓为季氏宰，问政，子曰：“先有司，赦小过，举贤才。”曰：“焉知贤才而举之？”曰：“举尔所知。尔所不知，人其舍诸？”</p>



<p>Zhong Gong, being chief minister to the head of the Ji family, asked about government. The Master said, “Employ first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.” Zhong Gong said, “How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?” He was answered, “Raise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?”</p>



<p>子路曰：“卫君待子而为政，子将奚先？”子曰：“必也正名乎！”子路曰：“有是哉，子之迂也！奚其正？”子曰：“野哉由也！君子于其所不知，盖阙如也。名不正，则言不顺；言不顺，则事不成；事不成，则礼乐不兴；礼乐不兴，则刑罚不中；刑罚不中，则民无所措手足。故君子名之必可言也，言之必可行也。君子于其言，无所苟而已矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Lu said, “The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?” The Master replied, “What is necessary is to rectify names.” “So! indeed!” said Zi Lu. “You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?” The Master said, “How uncultivated you are, You! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music will not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.”</p>



<p>樊迟请学稼，子曰：“吾不如老农。”请学为圃，曰：“吾不如老圃。”樊迟出，子曰：“小人哉樊须也！上好礼，则民莫敢不敬；上好义，则民莫敢不服；上好信，则民莫敢不用情。夫如是，则四方之民襁负其子而至矣，焉用稼？”</p>



<p>Fan Chi requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, “I am not so good for that as an old husbandman.” He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, “I am not so good for that as an old gardener.” Fan Chi having gone out, the Master said, “A small man, indeed, is Fan Xu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs – what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?”</p>



<p>子曰：“诵《诗》三百，授之以政，不达；使于四方，不能专对；虽多，亦奚以为？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?”</p>



<p>子曰：“其身正，不令而行；其身不正，虽令不从。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When a prince’s personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be followed.”</p>



<p>子曰：“鲁卫之政，兄弟也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.”</p>



<p>子谓卫公子荆，“善居室。始有，曰：‘苟合矣。’少有，曰：‘苟完矣。’富有，曰：‘苟美矣。’”</p>



<p>The Master said of Jing, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, “Ha! here is a collection!” When they were a little increased, he said, “Ha! this is complete!” When he had become rich, he said, “Ha! this is admirable!”</p>



<p>子适卫，冉有仆，子曰：“庶矣哉！”冉有曰：“既庶矣，又何加焉？”曰：“富之。”曰：“既富矣，又何加焉？”曰：“教之。”</p>



<p>When the Master went to Wei, Zan You acted as driver of his carriage. The Master observed, “How numerous are the people!” You said, “Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?” “Enrich them,” was the reply. “And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?” The Master said, “Teach them.”</p>



<p>子曰：“苟有用我者，期月而已可也，三年有成。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If there were (any of the princes) who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.”</p>



<p>子曰：“‘善人为邦百年，亦可以胜残去杀矣。’诚哉是言也！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “‘If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.’ True indeed is this saying!”</p>



<p>子曰：“如有王者，必世而后仁。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would still require a generation, and then virtue would prevail.”</p>



<p>子曰：“苟正其身矣，于从政乎何有？不能正其身，如正人何？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If a minister make his own conduct correct, what difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?”</p>



<p>冉子退朝，子曰：“何晏也？”对曰：“有政。”子曰：“其事也。如有政，虽不吾以，吾其与闻之。”</p>



<p>The disciple Ran returning from the court, the Master said to him, “How are you so late?” He replied, “We had government business.” The Master said, “It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business, though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.”</p>



<p>定公问：“一言而可以兴邦，有诸？”孔子对曰：“言不可以若是，其几也。人之言曰：‘为君难，为臣不易。’如知为君之难也，不几乎一言而兴邦乎？”曰：“一言而丧邦，有诸？”孔子对曰：“言不可以若是其几也。人之言曰：‘予无乐乎为君，唯其言而莫予违也。’如其善而莫之违也，不亦善乎？如不善而莫之违也，不几乎一言而丧邦乎？”</p>



<p>The Duke Ding asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, “Such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence. There is a saying, however, which people have – ‘To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.’ If a ruler knows this – the difficulty of being a prince – may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his country?” The duke then said, “Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?” Confucius replied, “Such an effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have – ‘I have no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!’ If a ruler’s words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?”</p>



<p>叶公问政，子曰：“近者说，远者来。”</p>



<p>The duke of She asked about government. The Master said, “Good government obtains, when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.”</p>



<p>子夏为莒父宰，问政，子曰：“无欲速，无见小利。欲速则不达，见小利则大事不成。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia, being governor of Ju Fu, asked about government. The Master said, “Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.”</p>



<p>叶公语孔子曰：“吾党有直躬者，其父攘羊，而子证之。”孔子曰：“吾党之直者异于是。父为子隐，子为父隐，直在其中矣。”</p>



<p>The Duke of She informed Confucius, saying, “Among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.” Confucius said, “Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.”</p>



<p>樊迟问仁，子曰：“居处恭，执事敬，与人忠。虽之夷狄，不可弃也。”</p>



<p>Fan Chi asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, “It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere. Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.”</p>



<p>子贡问曰：“何如斯可谓之士矣？”子曰：“行己有耻，使于四方不辱君命，可谓士矣。”曰：“敢问其次。”曰：“宗族称孝焉，乡党称弟焉。”曰：“敢问其次。”曰：“言必信，行必果，硁硁然小人哉！抑亦可以为次矣。”曰：“今之从政者何如？”子曰：“噫！斗筲之人，何足算也！”</p>



<p>Zi Gong asked, saying, “What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, “He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his prince’s commission, deserves to be called an officer.” Zi Gong pursued, “I venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?” And he was told, “He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be fraternal.” Again the disciple asked, “I venture to ask about the class still next in order.” The Master said, “They are determined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class.” Zi Gong finally inquired, “Of what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?” The Master said “Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.”</p>



<p>子曰：“不得中行而与之，必也狂狷乎！狂者进取，狷者有所不为也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.”</p>



<p>子曰：“南人有言曰：‘人而无恒，不可以作巫医。’善夫！”“不恒其德，或承之羞。”子曰：“不占而已矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The people of the south have a saying – ‘A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.’ Good! Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.” The Master said, “This arises simply from not attending to the prognostication.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子和而不同，小人同而不和。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.”</p>



<p>子贡问曰：“乡人皆好之，何如？”子曰：“未可也。”“乡人皆恶之，何如？”子曰：“未可也。不如乡人之善者好之，其不善者恶之。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong asked, saying, “What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?” The Master replied, “We may not for that accord our approval of him.” “And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?” The Master said, “We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子易事而难说也，说之不以道不说也，及其使人也器之；小人难事而易说也，说之虽不以道说也，及其使人也求备焉。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to everything.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子泰而不骄，小人骄而不泰。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.”</p>



<p>子曰：“刚、毅、木、讷近仁。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.”</p>



<p>子路问曰：“何如斯可谓之士矣？”子曰：“切切偲偲，怡怡如也，可谓士矣。朋友切切偲偲，兄弟怡怡。”</p>



<p>Zi Lu asked, saying, “What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?” The Master said, “He must be thus: earnest, urgent, and bland – among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren, bland.”</p>



<p>子曰：“善人教民七年，亦可以即戎矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war.”</p>



<p>子曰：“以不教民战，是谓弃之。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.”</p>

<p>宪问耻，子曰：“邦有道，谷；邦无道，谷，耻也。”“克、伐、怨、欲不行焉，可以为仁矣？”子曰：“可以为难矣，仁则吾不知也。”</p>



<p>Xian asked what was shameful. The Master said, “When good government prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary – this is shameful.” “When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue.” The Master said, “This may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect virtue.”</p>



<p>子曰：“士而怀居，不足以为士矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.”</p>



<p>子曰：“邦有道，危言危行；邦无道，危行言孙。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.”</p>



<p>子曰：“有德者必有言，有言者不必有德。仁者必有勇，勇者不必有仁。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.”</p>



<p>南宫适问于孔子曰：“羿善射，奡荡舟，俱不得其死然；禹、稷躬稼而有天下。”夫子不答。南宫适出，子曰：“君子哉若人！尚德哉若人！”</p>



<p>Nan Gong Kuo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, “Yi was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Ji personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.” The Master made no reply; but when Nan Gong Kuo went out, he said, “A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子而不仁者有矣夫，未有小人而仁者也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.”</p>



<p>子曰：“爱之，能勿劳乎？忠焉，能勿诲乎？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?”</p>



<p>子曰：“为命，裨谌草创之，世叔讨论之，行人子羽修饰之，东里子产润色之。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “In preparing the governmental notifications, Pi Shen first made the rough draft; Shi Shu examined and discussed its contents; Zi Yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally, Zi Chan of Dong Li gave it the proper elegance and finish.”</p>



<p>或问子产，子曰：“惠人也。”问子西，曰：“彼哉，彼哉！”问管仲，曰：“人也。夺伯氏骈邑三百，饭疏食，没齿无怨言。”</p>



<p>Some one asked about Zi Chan. The Master said, “He was a kind man.” He asked about Zi Xi. The Master said, “That man! That man!” He asked about Guan Zhong. “For him,” said the Master, “the city of Pian, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Bo family, who though to the end of his life he had only coarse rice to eat did not utter a murmuring word.”</p>



<p>子曰：“贫而无怨难，富而无骄易。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.”</p>



<p>子曰：“孟公绰为赵、魏老则优，不可以为滕、薛大夫。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Meng Gong Chuo is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Zhao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer to either of the States Teng or Xue.”</p>



<p>子路问成人，子曰：“若臧武仲之知、公绰之不欲、卞庄子之勇、冉求之艺，文之以礼乐，亦可以为成人矣。”曰：“今之成人者何必然？见利思义，见危授命，久要不忘平生之言，亦可以为成人矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, “Suppose a man with the knowledge of Zang Wu Zhong, the freedom from covetousness of Gong Chuo, the bravery of Zhuang of Bian, and the varied talents of Ran Qiu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and music – such a one might be reckoned a COMPLETE man.” He then added, “But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends – such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.”</p>



<p>子问公叔文子于公明贾曰：“信乎，夫子不言，不笑，不取乎？”公明贾对曰：“以告者过也。夫子时然后言，人不厌其言；乐然后笑，人不厌其笑；义然后取，人不厌其取。”子曰：“其然？岂其然乎？”</p>



<p>The Master asked Gong Ming Jia about Gong Ming Wen, saying, “Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?” Gong Ming Jia replied, “This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth. My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking.” The Master said, “So! But is it so with him?”</p>



<p>子曰：“臧武仲以防求为后于鲁，虽曰不要君，吾不信也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Zang Wu Zhong, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.”</p>



<p>子曰：“晋文公谲而不正，齐桓公正而不谲。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The duke Wen of Jin was crafty and not upright. The duke Huan of Qi was upright and not crafty.”</p>



<p>子路曰：“桓公杀公子纠，召忽死之，管仲不死，曰未仁乎？”子曰：“桓公九合诸侯不以兵车，管仲之力也。如其仁，如其仁！”</p>



<p>Zi Lu said, “The duke Huan caused his brother Jiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died with his master, but Guan Zhong did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?” The Master said, “The Duke Huan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots – it was all through the influence of Guan Zhong. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like his?”</p>



<p>子贡曰：“管仲非仁者与？桓公杀公子纠，不能死，又相之。”子曰：“管仲相桓公霸诸侯，一匡天下，民到于今受其赐。微管仲，吾其被发左衽矣。岂若匹夫匹妇之为谅也，自经于沟渎而莫之知也。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong said, “Guan Zhong, I apprehend, was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Huan caused his brother Jiu to be killed, Guan Zhong was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Huan.” The Master said, “Guan Zhong acted as prime minister to the duke Huan, made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for Guan Zhong, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side. Will you require from him the small fidelity of common men and common women, who would commit suicide in a stream or ditch, no one knowing anything about them?”</p>



<p>公叔文子之臣大夫僎与文子同升诸公，子闻之,曰：“可以为‘文’矣。”</p>



<p>The great officer, Xian, who had been family minister to Gong Ming Wen, ascended to the prince’s court in company with Wen. The Master, having heard of it, said, “He deserved to be considered WEN (the accomplished).”</p>



<p>子言卫灵公之无道也，康子曰：“夫如是，奚而不丧？”孔子曰：“仲叔圉治宾客，祝鮀治宗庙，王孙贾治军旅，夫如是，奚其丧？”</p>



<p>The Master was speaking about the unprincipled course of the duke Ling of Wei, when Qi Kang said, “Since he is of such a character, how is it he does not lose his state?” Confucius said, “The Zhong Shu Yu has the superintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, Tuo, has the management of his ancestral temple; and Wang Sun Jia has the direction of the army and forces – with such officers as these, how should he lose his state?”</p>



<p>子曰：“其言之不怍，则为之也难。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “He who speaks without modesty will find it difficult to make his words good.”</p>



<p>陈成子弑简公，孔子沐浴而朝，告于哀公曰：“陈恒弑其君，请讨之。”公曰：“告夫三子。”,孔子曰：“以吾从大夫之后，不敢不告也，君曰‘告夫三子’者！”之三子告，不可。孔子曰：“以吾从大夫之后，不敢不告也。”</p>



<p>Chen Cheng murdered the duke Jian of Qi. Confucius bathed, went to court and informed the duke Ai, saying, “Chen Heng has slain his sovereign. I beg that you will undertake to punish him.” The duke said, “Inform the chiefs of the three families of it.” Confucius retired, and said, “Following in the rear of the great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter, and my prince says, ‘Inform the chiefs of the three families of it.’” He went to the chiefs, and informed them, but they would not act. Confucius then said, “Following in the rear of the great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter.”</p>



<p>子路问事君，子曰：“勿欺也，而犯之。”</p>



<p>Zi Lu asked how a ruler should be served. The Master said, “Do not impose on him, and, moreover, withstand him to his face.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子上达，小人下达。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The progress of the superior man is upwards; the progress of the mean man is downwards.”</p>



<p>子曰：“古之学者为己，今之学者为人。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to the approbation of others.”</p>



<p>蘧伯玉使人于孔子，孔子与之坐而问焉，曰：“夫子何为？”对曰：“夫子欲寡其过而未能也。”使者出，子曰：“使乎！使乎！”</p>



<p>Qu Bo sent a messenger with friendly inquiries to Confucius. Confucius sat with him, and questioned him. “What,” said he! “is your master engaged in?” The messenger replied, “My master is anxious to make his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded.” He then went out, and the Master said, “A messenger indeed! A messenger indeed!”</p>



<p>子曰：“不在其位，不谋其政。”曾子曰：“君子思不出其位。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.” The philosopher Zeng said, “The superior man, in his thoughts, does not go out of his place.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子耻其言而过其行。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子道者三，我无能焉：仁者不忧，知者不惑，勇者不惧。”子贡曰：“夫子自道也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear.” Zi Gong said, “Master, that is what you yourself say.”</p>



<p>子贡方人，子曰：“赐也贤乎哉？夫我则不暇。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong was in the habit of comparing men together. The Master said, “Ci must have reached a high pitch of excellence! Now, I have not leisure for this.”</p>



<p>子曰：“不患人之不己知，患其不能也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I will not be concerned at men’s not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability.”</p>



<p>子曰：“不逆诈，不亿不信，抑亦先觉者，是贤乎！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and yet apprehends these things readily (when they occur) – is he not a man of superior worth?”</p>



<p>微生亩谓孔子曰：“丘何为是栖栖者与？无乃为佞乎？”孔子曰：“非敢为佞也，疾固也。”</p>



<p>Wei Sheng Mu said to Confucius, “Qiu, how is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an insinuating talker? Confucius said, “I do not dare to play the part of such a talker, but I hate obstinacy.”</p>



<p>子曰：“骥不称其力，称其德也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “A horse is called a Ji, not because of its strength, but because of its other good qualities.”</p>



<p>或曰：“以德报怨，何如？”子曰：“何以报德？以直报怨，以德报德。”</p>



<p>Some one said, “What do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?” The Master said, “With what then will you recompense kindness? Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness.”</p>



<p>子曰：“莫我知也夫！”子贡曰：“何为其莫知子也？”子曰：“不怨天，不尤人，下学而上达。知我者其天乎！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Alas! there is no one that knows me.” Zi Gong said, “What do you mean by thus saying – that no one knows you?” The Master replied, “I do not murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there is Heaven – that knows me!”</p>



<p>公伯寮愬子路于季孙。子服景伯以告，曰：“夫子固有惑志于公伯寮，吾力犹能肆诸市朝。”子曰：“道之将行也与，命也；道之将废也与，命也。公伯寮其如命何？”</p>



<p>The Gong Bo Liao, having slandered Zi Lu to Ji Sun, Zi Fu Jing Bo informed Confucius of it, saying, “Our master is certainly being led astray by the Gong Bo Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court.” The Master said, “If my principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can the Gong Bo Liao do where such ordering is concerned?”</p>



<p>子曰：“贤者辟世，其次辟地，其次辟色，其次辟言。”子曰：“作者七人矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Some men of worth retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks. Some retire because of contradictory language.” The Master said, “Those who have done this are seven men.”</p>



<p>子路宿于石门，晨门曰：“奚自？”子路曰：“自孔氏。”曰：“是知其不可而为之者与？”</p>



<p>Zi Lu happening to pass the night in Shi Men, the gatekeeper said to him, “Whom do you come from?” Zi Lu said, “From Mr. Kong.” “It is he, is it not?” said the other, “who knows the impracticable nature of the times and yet will be doing in them.”</p>



<p>子击磬于卫，有荷蒉而过孔氏之门者，曰：“有心哉，击磬乎！”既而曰：“鄙哉，硁硁乎！莫己知也，斯已而已矣。深则厉，浅则揭。”子曰：“果哉！末之难矣。”</p>



<p>The Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Wei, when a man, carrying a straw basket, passed door of the house where Confucius was, and said, “His heart is full who so beats the musical stone.” A little while after, he added, “How contemptible is the one-ideaed obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken no notice of, he has simply at once to give over his wish for public employment. ‘Deep water must be crossed with the clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held up.’” The Master said, “How determined is he in his purpose! But this is not difficult!”</p>



<p>子张曰：“《书》云，‘高宗谅阴，三年不言。’何谓也？”子曰：“何必高宗，古之人皆然。君薨，百官总己以听于冢宰三年。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang said, “When the Shu says that Gao Zong, while observing the usual imperial mourning, was for three years without speaking, what is meant by this?” The Master said, “Why must Gao Zong be referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years.”</p>



<p>子曰：“上好礼，则民易使也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to the calls on them for service.”</p>



<p>子路问君子，子曰：“修己以敬。”曰：“如斯而已乎？”曰：“修己以安人。”曰：“如斯而已乎？”曰：“修己以安百姓。修己以安百姓，尧、舜其犹病诸！”</p>



<p>Zi Lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, “The cultivation of himself in reverential carefulness.” “And is this all?” said Zi Lu. “He cultivates himself so as to give rest to others,” was the reply. “And is this all?” again asked Zi Lu. The Master said, “He cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people – even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.”</p>



<p>原壤夷俟，子曰：“幼而不孙弟，长而无述焉，老而不死，是为贼！”以杖叩其胫。</p>



<p>Yuan Rang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, “In youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age – this is to be a pest.” With this he hit him on the shank with his staff.</p>



<p>阙党童子将命，或问之曰：“益者与？”子曰：“吾见其居于位也，见其与先生并行也。非求益者也，欲速成者也。”</p>



<p>A youth of the village of Que was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, “I suppose he has made great progress.” The Master said, “I observe that he is fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.”</p>

<p>卫灵公问陈于孔子，孔子对曰：“俎豆之事，则尝闻之矣；军旅之事，未之学也。”明日遂行。</p>



<p>The duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, “I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military matters.” On this, he took his departure the next day.</p>



<p>在陈绝粮，从者病莫能兴。子路愠见曰：“君子亦有穷乎？”子曰：“君子固穷，小人穷斯滥矣。”</p>



<p>When he was in Chen, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers became so ill that they were unable to rise. Zi Lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, “Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?” The Master said, “The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.”</p>



<p>子曰：“赐也，女以予为多学而识之者与？”对曰：“然，非与？”曰：“非也，予一以贯之。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Ci, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?” Zi Gong replied, “Yes – but perhaps it is not so?” “No,” was the answer; “I seek a unity all pervading.”</p>



<p>子曰：“由，知德者鲜矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “You, those who know virtue are few.”</p>



<p>子曰：“无为而治者其舜也与！夫何为哉？恭己正南面而已矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.”</p>



<p>子张问行，子曰：“言忠信，行笃敬，虽蛮貊之邦行矣；言不忠信，行不笃敬，虽州里行乎哉？立则见其参于前也；在舆则见其倚于衡也，夫然后行。”子张书诸绅。</p>



<p>Zi Zhang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. The Master said, “Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful – such conduct may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful, and his actions not honorable and careful, will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his neighborhood? When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into practice.”Zi Zhang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash.</p>



<p>子曰：“直哉史鱼！邦有道如矢，邦无道如矢。君子哉蘧伯玉！邦有道则仕，邦无道则可卷而怀之。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Qu Bo Yu! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast.”</p>



<p>子曰：“可与言而不与之言，失人；不可与言而与之言，失言。知者不失人亦不失言。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to their man nor to their words.”</p>



<p>子曰：“志士仁人无求生以害仁，有杀身以成仁。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete.”</p>



<p>子贡问为仁，子曰：“工欲善其事，必先利其器。居是邦也，事其大夫之贤者，友其士之仁者。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, “The mechanic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharpen his tools. When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy among its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its scholars.”</p>



<p>颜渊问为邦，子曰：“行夏之时，乘殷之辂，服周之冕，乐则《韶》、《舞》；放郑声，远佞人。郑声淫，佞人殆。”</p>



<p>Yan Yuan asked how the government of a country should be administered. The Master said, “Follow the seasons of Xia. Ride in the state carriage of Yin. Wear the ceremonial cap of Zhou. Let the music be the Shao with its pantomimes. Banish the songs of Zheng, and keep far from specious talkers. The songs of Zheng are licentious; specious talkers are dangerous.”</p>



<p>子曰：“人无远虑，必有近忧。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “If a man take no thought about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.”</p>



<p>子曰：“已矣乎！吾未见好德如好色者也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “It is all over! I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.”</p>



<p>子曰：“臧文仲其窃位者与！知柳下惠之贤而不与立也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Was not Zang Wen like one who had stolen his situation? He knew the virtue and the talents of Hui of Liu Xia, and yet did not procure that he should stand with him in court.”</p>



<p>子曰：“躬自厚而薄责于人，则远怨矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “He who requires much from himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the object of resentment.”</p>



<p>子曰：“不曰‘如之何、如之何’者，吾末如之何也已矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When a man is not in the habit of saying, ‘What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?’ I can indeed do nothing with him!”</p>



<p>子曰：“群居终日，言不及义，好行小慧，难矣哉！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When a number of people are together, for a whole day, without their conversation turning on righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying out the suggestions of a small shrewdness; theirs is indeed a hard case.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子义以为质，礼以行之，孙以出之，信以成之。君子哉！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed a superior man.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子病无能焉，不病人之不己知也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men’s not knowing him.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子疾没世而名不称焉。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man dislikes the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子求诸己，小人求诸人。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “What the superior man seeks, is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子矜而不争，群而不党。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a partisan.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子不以言举人，不以人废言。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words because of the man.”</p>



<p>子贡问曰：“有一言而可以终身行之者乎？”子曰：“其恕乎！己所不欲，勿施于人。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong asked, saying, “Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one’s life?” The Master said, “Is not RECIPROCITY such a word? What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.”</p>



<p>子曰：“吾之于人也，谁毁谁誉？如有所誉者，其有所试矣。斯民也，三代之所以直道而行也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “In my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, beyond what is proper? If I do sometimes exceed in praise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the individual. This people supplied the ground why the three dynasties pursued the path of straightforwardness.”</p>



<p>子曰：“吾犹及史之阙文也，有马者借人乘之，今亡矣夫！”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Even in my early days, a historiographer would leave a blank in his text, and he who had a horse would lend him to another to ride. Now, alas! there are no such things.”</p>



<p>子曰：“巧言乱德，小不忍，则乱大谋。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Specious words confound virtue. Want of forbearance in small matters confounds great plans.”</p>



<p>子曰：“众恶之，必察焉；众好之，必察焉。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When the multitude hate a man, it is necessary to examine into the case. When the multitude like a man, it is necessary to examine into the case.”</p>



<p>子曰：“人能弘道，非道弘人。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “A man can enlarge the principles which he follows; those principles do not enlarge the man.”</p>



<p>子曰：“过而不改，是谓过矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “To have faults and not to reform them – this, indeed, should be pronounced having faults.”</p>



<p>子曰：“吾尝终日不食、终夜不寝以思，无益，不如学也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I have been the whole day without eating, and the whole night without sleeping; occupied with thinking. It was of no use. The better plan is to learn.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子谋道不谋食。耕也馁在其中矣，学也禄在其中矣。君子忧道不忧贫。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing – even in that there is sometimes want. So with learning – emolument may be found in it. The superior man is anxious lest he should not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him.”</p>



<p>子曰：“知及之，仁不能守之，虽得之，必失之；知及之，仁能守之，不庄以莅之，则民不敬；知及之，仁能守之，庄以莅之，动之不以礼，未善也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When a man’s knowledge is sufficient to attain, and his virtue is not sufficient to enable him to hold, whatever he may have gained, he will lose again. When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue enough to hold fast, if he cannot govern with dignity, the people will not respect him. When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue enough to hold fast; when he governs also with dignity, yet if he try to move the people contrary to the rules of propriety – full excellence is not reached.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子不可小知而可大受也，小人不可大受而可小知也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man cannot be known in little matters; but he may be intrusted with great concerns. The small man may not be intrusted with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters.”</p>



<p>子曰：“民之于仁也，甚于水火。水火，吾见蹈而死者矣，未见蹈仁而死者也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Virtue is more to man than either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on water and fire, but I have never seen a man die from treading the course of virtue.”</p>



<p>子曰：“当仁不让于师。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Let every man consider virtue as what devolves on himself. He may not yield the performance of it even to his teacher.”</p>



<p>子曰：“君子贞而不谅。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “The superior man is correctly firm, and not firm merely.”</p>



<p>子曰：“事君，敬其事而后其食。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “A minister, in serving his prince, reverently discharges his duties, and makes his emolument a secondary consideration.”</p>



<p>子曰：“有教无类。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “In teaching there should be no distinction of classes.”</p>



<p>子曰：“道不同，不相为谋。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Those whose courses are different cannot lay plans for one another.”</p>



<p>子曰：“辞达而已矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “In language it is simply required that it convey the meaning.”</p>



<p>师冕见，及阶，子曰：“阶也。”及席，子曰：“席也。”皆坐，子告之曰：“某在斯，某在斯。”师冕出。子张问曰：“与师言之道与？”子曰：“然，固相师之道也。”</p>



<p>The music master, Mian, having called upon him, when they came to the steps, the Master said, “Here are the steps.” When they came to the mat for the guest to sit upon, he said, “Here is the mat.” When all were seated, the Master informed him, saying, “So and so is here; so and so is here.” The music master, Mian, having gone out, Zi Zhang asked, saying. “Is it the rule to tell those things to the music master?” The Master said, “Yes. This is certainly the rule for those who lead the blind.”</p>

<p>季氏将伐颛臾，冉有、季路见于孔子，曰：“季氏将有事于颛臾。”孔子曰：“求，无乃尔是过与？夫颛臾，昔者先王以为东蒙主，且在邦域之中矣，是社稷之臣也。何以伐为？”冉有曰：“夫子欲之，吾二臣者皆不欲也。”孔子曰：“求，周任有言曰：‘陈力就列，不能者止。’危而不持，颠而不扶，则将焉用彼相矣？且尔言过矣，虎兕出于柙，龟玉毁于椟中，是谁之过与？”冉有曰：“今夫颛臾固而近于费，今不取，后世必为子孙忧。”孔子曰：“求，君子疾夫舍曰欲之而必为之辞。丘也闻，有国有家者，不患寡而患不均，不患贫而患不安。盖均无贫，和无寡，安无倾。夫如是，故远人不服则修文德以来之，既来之，则安之。今由与求也相夫子，远人不服而不能来也，邦分崩离析而不能守也，而谋动干戈于邦内。吾恐季孙之忧不在颛臾，而在萧墙之内也。”</p>



<p>The head of the Ji family was going to attack Zhuan Yu. Ran You and Ji Lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, “Our chief, Ji, is going to commence operations against Zhuan Yu.” Confucius said, “Qiu, is it not you who are in fault here? Now, in regard to Zhuan Yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign – What has your chief to do with attacking it?” Ran You said, “Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.” Confucius said, “Qiu, there are the words of Zhou Ren, ‘When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?’ And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository – whose is the fault?” Ran You said, “But at present, Zhuan Yu is strong and near to Fei; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants.” Confucius said. “Qiu, the superior man hates those declining to say ‘I want such and such a thing,’ and framing explanations for their conduct. I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings. So it is. Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made contented and tranquil. Now, here are you, You and Qiu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory there are divisions and downfalls, leavings and separations, and, with your help, he cannot preserve it. And yet he is planning these hostile movements within the state. I am afraid that the sorrow of the Ji Sun family will not be on account of Zhuan Yu, but will be found within the screen of their own court.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“天下有道，则礼乐征伐自天子出；天下无道，则礼乐征伐自诸侯出。自诸侯出，盖十世希不失矣；自大夫出，五世希不失矣；陪臣执国命，三世希不失矣。天下有道，则政不在大夫；天下有道，则庶人不议。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great officers of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in three generations. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the great officers. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the common people.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“禄之去公室五世矣，政逮于大夫四世矣，故夫三桓之子孙微矣。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “The revenue of the state has left the ducal house now for five generations. The government has been in the hands of the great officers for four generations. On this account, the descendants of the three Huan are much reduced.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“益者三友，损者三友。友直、友谅、友多闻，益矣；友便辟、友善柔、友便佞，损矣。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “There are three friendships which are advantageous, and three which are injurious. Friendship with the uplight; friendship with the sincere; and friendship with the man of much observation – these are advantageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; friendship with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the glib-tongued – these are injurious.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“益者三乐，损者三乐。乐节礼乐、乐道人之善、乐多贤友，益矣；乐骄乐、乐佚游、乐宴乐，损矣。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “There are three things men find enjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they find enjoyment in which are injurious. To find enjoyment in the discriminating study of ceremonies and music; to find enjoyment in speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having many worthy friends – these are advantageous. To find enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in idleness and sauntering; to find enjoyment in the pleasures of feasting – these are injurious.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“侍于君子有三愆：言未及之而言谓之躁，言及之而不言谓之隐，未见颜色而言谓之瞽。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “There are three errors to which they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station are liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to speak – this is called rashness. They may not speak when it comes to them to speak – this is called concealment. They may speak without looking at the countenance of their superior – this is called blindness.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“君子有三戒：少之时，血气未定，戒之在色；及其壮也，血气方刚，戒之在斗；及其老也，血气既衰，戒之在得。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “There are three things which the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical powers are not yet settled, he guards against lust. When he is strong and the physical powers are full of vigor, he guards against quarrelsomeness. When he is old, and the animal powers are decayed, he guards against covetousness.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“君子有三畏：畏天命，畏大人，畏圣人之言。小人不知天命而不畏也，狎大人，侮圣人之言。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “There are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of sages. The mean man does not know the ordinances of Heaven, and consequently does not stand in awe of them. He is disrespectful to great men. He makes sport of the words of sages.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“生而知之者上也，学而知之者次也；困而学之又其次也。困而不学，民斯为下矣。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “Those who are born with the possession of knowledge are the highest class of men. Those who learn, and so, readily, get possession of knowledge, are the next. Those who are dull and stupid, and yet compass the learning, are another class next to these. As to those who are dull and stupid and yet do not learn – they are the lowest of the people.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“君子有九思：视思明，听思聪，色思温，貌思恭，言思忠，事思敬，疑思问，忿思难，见得思义。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “The superior man has nine things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. In regard to the use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear distinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be benign. In regard to his demeanor, he is anxious that it should be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that it should be reverently careful. In regard to what he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties (his anger may involve him in). When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of righteousness.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“见善如不及，见不善如探汤；吾见其人矣。吾闻其语矣。隐居以求其志，行义以达其道；吾闻其语矣，未见其人也。”</p>



<p>Confucius said, “Contemplating good, and pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil and shrinking from it, as they would from thrusting the hand into boiling water – I have seen such men, as I have heard such words. Living in retirement to study their aims, and practicing righteousness to carry out their principles – I have heard these words, but I have not seen such men.”</p>



<p>齐景公有马千驷，死之日，民无德而称焉；伯夷、叔齐饿于首阳之下，民到于今称之。其斯之谓与？”</p>



<p>The Duke Jing of Qi had a thousand teams, each of four horses, but on the day of his death, the people did not praise him for a single virtue. Bo Yi and Shu Qi died of hunger at the foot of the Shou Yang mountain, and the people, down to the present time, praise them. Is not that saying illustrated by this?</p>



<p>陈亢问于伯鱼曰：“子亦有异闻乎？”对曰：“未也。尝独立，鲤趋而过庭，曰：‘学《诗》乎？’对曰：‘未也。’‘不学《诗》，无以言。’鲤退而学《诗》。他日，又独立，鲤趋而过庭，曰：‘学《礼》乎？’对曰：‘未也。’‘不学《礼》，无以立。’鲤退而学《礼》。闻斯二者。”陈亢退而喜曰：“问一得三，闻《诗》，闻《礼》，又闻君子之远其子也。”</p>



<p>Chen Kang asked Bo Yu, saying, “Have you heard any lessons from your father different from what we have all heard?” Bo Yu replied, “No. He was standing alone once, when I passed below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, ‘Have you learned the Odes?’ On my replying ‘Not yet,’ he added, ‘If you do not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to converse with.’ I retired and studied the Odes. Another day, he was in the same way standing alone, when I passed by below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, ‘Have you learned the rules of Propriety?’ On my replying ‘Not yet,’ he added, ‘If you do not learn the rules of Propriety, your character cannot be established.’ I then retired, and learned the rules of Propriety. I have heard only these two things from him.” Chen Kang retired, and, quite delighted, said, “I asked one thing, and I have got three things. I have heard about the Odes. I have heard about the rules of Propriety. I have also heard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve towards his son.”</p>



<p>邦君之妻，君称之曰夫人，夫人自称曰小童；邦人称之曰君夫人，称诸异邦曰寡小君；异邦人称之亦曰君夫人。</p>



<p>The wife of the prince of a state is called by him “fu ren”. She calls herself “xiao tong”. The people of the state call her “jun fu ren”, and, to the people of other states, they call her “gua xiao jun”. The people of other states also call her “jun fu ren”.</p>

<p>阳货欲见孔子，孔子不见，归孔子豚。孔子时其亡也而往拜之，遇诸涂。谓孔子曰：“来，予与尔言。”曰：“怀其宝而迷其邦，可谓仁乎？”曰：“不可。”“好从事而亟失时，可谓知乎？”曰：“不可！”“日月逝矣，岁不我与！”孔子曰：“诺，吾将仕矣。”</p>



<p>Yang Huo wished to see Confucius, but Confucius would not go to see him. On this, he sent a present of a pig to Confucius, who, having chosen a time when Huo was not at home, went to pay his respects for the gift. He met him, however, on the way. Huo said to Confucius, “Come, let me speak with you.” He then asked, “Can he be called benevolent who keeps his jewel in his bosom, and leaves his country to confusion?” Confucius replied, “No.” “Can he be called wise, who is anxious to be engaged in public employment, and yet is constantly losing the opportunity of being so?” Confucius again said, “No.” “The days and months are passing away; the years do not wait for us.” Confucius said, “Right; I will go into office.”</p>



<p>子曰：“性相近也，习相远也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart.”</p>



<p>子曰：“唯上知与下愚不移。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “There are only the wise of the highest class, and the stupid of the lowest class, who cannot be changed.”</p>

<p>The Master, having come to Wu Cheng, heard there the sound of stringed instruments and singing. Well pleased and smiling, he said, “Why use an ox knife to kill a fowl?” Zi You replied, “Formerly, Master, I heard you say, ‘When the man of high station is well instructed, he loves men; when the man of low station is well instructed, he is easily ruled.’” The Master said, “My disciples, Yan’s words are right. What I said was only in sport.”</p>

<p>Gong Shan Fo Rao, when he was holding Fei, and in an attitude of rebellion, invited the Master to visit him, who was rather inclined to go. Zi Lu was displeased, and said, “Indeed, you cannot go! Why must you think of going to see Gong Shan?” The Master said, “Can it be without some reason that he has invited me? If any one employ me, may I not make an eastern Zhou?”</p>



<p>子张问仁于孔子，孔子曰：“能行五者于天下为仁矣。”请问之，曰：“恭、宽、信、敏、惠。恭则不侮，宽则得众，信则人任焉，敏则有功，惠则足以使人。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang asked Confucius about perfect virtue. Confucius said, “To be able to practice five things everywhere under heaven constitutes perfect virtue.” He begged to ask what they were, and was told, “Gravity, generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness. If you are grave, you will not be treated with disrespect. If you are generous, you will win all. If you are sincere, people will repose trust in you. If you are earnest, you will accomplish much. If you are kind, this will enable you to employ the services of others.”</p>

<p>Bi Xi inviting him to visit him, the Master was inclined to go. Zi Lu said, “Master, formerly I have heard you say, ‘When a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil, a superior man will not associate with him.’ Bi Xi is in rebellion, holding possession of Zhong Mou; if you go to him, what shall be said?” The Master said, “Yes, I did use these words. But is it not said, that, if a thing be really hard, it may be ground without being made thin? Is it not said, that, if a thing be really white, it may be steeped in a dark fluid without being made black? Am I a bitter gourd? How can I be hung up out of the way of being eaten?”</p>



<p>子曰：“由也，女闻六言六蔽矣乎？”对曰：“未也。”“居！吾语女。好仁不好学，其蔽也愚；好知不好学，其蔽也荡；好信不好学，其蔽也贼；好直不好学，其蔽也绞；好勇不好学，其蔽也乱；好刚不好学，其蔽也狂。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “You, have you heard the six words to which are attached six becloudings?” You replied, “I have not.” “Sit down, and I will tell them to you. There is the love of being benevolent without the love of learning – the beclouding here leads to a foolish simplicity. There is the love of knowing without the love of learning – the beclouding here leads to dissipation of mind. There is the love of being sincere without the love of learning – the beclouding here leads to an injurious disregard of consequences. There is the love of straightforwardness without the love of learning – the beclouding here leads to rudeness. There is the love of boldness without the love of learning – the beclouding here leads to insubordination. There is the love of firmness without the love of learning – the beclouding here leads to extravagant conduct.”</p>



<p>子曰：“小子何莫学夫《诗》？《诗》可以兴，可以观，可以群，可以怨。迩之事父，远之事君，多识于鸟兽草木之名。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “My children, why do you not study the Book of Poetry? The Odes serve to stimulate the mind. They may be used for purposes of self-contemplation. They teach the art of sociability. They show how to regulate feelings of resentment. From them you learn the more immediate duty of serving one’s father, and the remoter one of serving one’s prince. From them we become largely acquainted with the names of birds, beasts, and plants.”</p>



<p>子谓伯鱼曰：“女为《周南》、《召南》矣乎？人而不为《周南》、《召南》，其犹正墙面而立也与！”</p>



<p>The Master said to Bo Yu, “Do you give yourself to the Zhou Nan and the Shao Nan. The man who has not studied the Zhou Nan and the Shao Nan is like one who stands with his face right against a wall. Is he not so?”</p>



<p>子曰：“礼云礼云，玉帛云乎哉？乐云乐云，钟鼓云乎哉？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “‘It is according to the rules of propriety,’ they say. ‘It is according to the rules of propriety,’ they say. Are gems and silk all that is meant by propriety? ‘It is music,’ they say. ‘It is music,’ they say. Are bells and drums all that is meant by music?”</p>



<p>子曰：“色厉而内荏，譬诸小人，其犹穿窬之盗也与？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “He who puts on an appearance of stern firmness, while inwardly he is weak, is like one of the small, mean people – yea, is he not like the thief who breaks through, or climbs over, a wall?”</p>



<p>子曰：“乡愿，德之贼也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Your good, careful people of the villages are the thieves of virtue.”</p>



<p>子曰：“道听而涂说，德之弃也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “To tell, as we go along, what we have heard on the way, is to cast away our virtue.”</p>



<p>子曰：“鄙夫可与事君也与哉？其未得之也，患得之；既得之，患失之。苟患失之，无所不至矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “There are those mean creatures! How impossible it is along with them to serve one’s prince! While they have not got their aims, their anxiety is how to get them. When they have got them, their anxiety is lest they should lose them. When they are anxious lest such things should be lost, there is nothing to which they will not proceed.”</p>



<p>子曰：“古者民有三疾，今也或是之亡也。古之狂也肆，今之狂也荡；古之矜也廉，今之矜也忿戾；古之愚也直，今之愚也诈而已矣。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Anciently, men had three failings, which now perhaps are not to be found. The high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a disregard of small things; the high-mindedness of the present day shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity showed itself in grave reserve; the stern dignity of the present day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness. The stupidity of antiquity showed itself in straightforwardness; the stupidity of the present day shows itself in sheer deceit.”</p>



<p>子曰：“巧言令色，鲜矣仁。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with virtue.”</p>



<p>子曰：“恶紫之夺朱也，恶郑声之乱雅乐也，恶利口之覆邦家者。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I hate the manner in which purple takes away the luster of vermilion. I hate the way in which the songs of Zheng confound the music of the Ya. I hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms and families.”</p>



<p>子曰：“予欲无言。”子贡曰：“子如不言，则小子何述焉？”子曰：“天何言哉？四时行焉，百物生焉，天何言哉？”</p>



<p>The Master said, “I would prefer not speaking.” Zi Gong said, “If you, Master, do not speak, what shall we, your disciples, have to record?” The Master said, “Does Heaven speak? The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven say anything?”</p>



<p>孺悲欲见孔子，孔子辞以疾。将命者出户，取瑟而歌，使之闻之。</p>



<p>Ru Bei wished to see Confucius, but Confucius declined, on the ground of being sick, to see him. When the bearer of this message went out at the door, (the Master) took his lute and sang to it, in order that Bei might hear him.</p>



<p>宰我问：“三年之丧，期已久矣！君子三年不为礼，礼必坏；三年不为乐，乐必崩。旧谷既没，新谷既升，钻燧改火，期可已矣。”子曰：“食夫稻，衣夫锦，于女安乎？”曰：“安！”“女安则为之！夫君子之居丧，食旨不甘，闻乐不乐，居处不安，故不为也。今女安，则为之！”宰我出，子曰：“予之不仁也！子生三年，然后免于父母之怀。夫三年之丧，天下之通丧也，予也有三年之爱于其父母乎！”</p>



<p>Zai Wo asked about the three years’ mourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough. “If the superior man abstains for three years from the observances of propriety, those observances will be quite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will be ruined. Within a year the old grain is exhausted, and the new grain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go through all the changes of wood for that purpose. After a complete year, the mourning may stop.” The Master said, “If you were, after a year, to eat good rice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at ease?” “I should,” replied Wo. The Master said, “If you can feel at ease, do it. But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.” Zai Wo then went out, and the Master said, “This shows Yu’s want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years’ mourning is universally observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years’ love of his parents?”</p>



<p>子曰：“饱食终日，无所用心，难矣哉！不有博弈者乎？为之犹贤乎已。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Hard is it to deal with who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all.”</p>



<p>子路曰：“君子尚勇乎？”子曰：“君子义以为上。君子有勇而无义为乱，小人有勇而无义为盗。”</p>



<p>Zi Lu said, “Does the superior man esteem valor?” The Master said, “The superior man holds righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without righteousness, will commit robbery.”</p>



<p>子贡曰：“君子亦有恶乎？”子曰：“有恶。恶称人之恶者，恶居下流而讪上者，恶勇而无礼者，恶果敢而窒者。”曰：“赐也亦有恶乎？”“恶徼以为知者，恶不孙以为勇者，恶讦以为直者。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong said, “Has the superior man his hatreds also?” The Master said, “He has his hatreds. He hates those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same time, of contracted understanding.” The Master then inquired, “Ci, have you also your hatreds?” Zi Gong replied, “I hate those who pry out matters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward.”</p>



<p>子曰：“唯女子与小人为难养也，近之则不逊，远之则怨。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are discontented.”</p>



<p>子曰：“年四十而见恶焉，其终也已。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “When a man at forty is the object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.”</p>

<p>The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Ji became a slave to Zhou. Bi Gan remonstrated with him and died. Confucius said, “The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue.”</p>



<p>柳下惠为士师，三黜。人曰：“子未可以去乎？”曰：“直道而事人，焉往而不三黜？枉道而事人，何必去父母之邦？”</p>



<p>Hui of Liu Xia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Some one said to him, “Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this?” He replied, “Serving men in an upright way, where shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?”</p>



<p>齐景公待孔子曰：“若季氏，则吾不能。”以季、孟之间待之，曰：“吾老矣，不能用也。”孔子行。</p>



<p>The duke Jing of Qi, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, “I cannot treat him as I would the chief of the Ji family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the chief of the Ji, and that given to the chief of the Meng family.” He also said, “I am old; I cannot use his doctrines.” Confucius took his departure.</p>



<p>齐人归女乐，季桓子受之，三日不朝，孔子行。”</p>



<p>The people of Qi sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Ji Huan received, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took his departure.</p>



<p>楚狂接舆歌而过孔子曰：“凤兮凤兮，何德之衰？往者不可谏，来者犹可追。已而已而，今之从政者殆而！”孔子下，欲与之言，趋而辟之，不得与之言。</p>



<p>The madman of Chu, Jie Yu, passed by Confucius, singing and saying, “O Feng! O Feng! How is your virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the future may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of government.” Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Jie Yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with him.</p>



<p>长沮、桀溺耦而耕，孔子过之，使子路问津焉。长沮曰：“夫执舆者为谁？”子路曰：“为孔丘。”曰：“是鲁孔丘与？”曰：“是也。”曰：“是知津矣。”问于桀溺，桀溺曰：“子为谁？”曰：“为仲由。”曰：“是鲁孔丘之徒与？”对曰：“然。”曰：“滔滔者天下皆是也，而谁以易之？且而与其从辟人之士也，岂若从辟世之士？”耰而不辍。子路行以告，夫子怃然曰：“鸟兽不可与同群，吾非斯人之徒与而谁与？天下有道，丘不与易也。”</p>



<p>Chang Zu and Jie Ni were at work in the field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Zi Lu to inquire for the ford. Chang Zu said, “Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?” Zi Lu told him, “It is Kong Qiu.’, “Is it not Kong Qiu of Lu?” asked he. “Yes,” was the reply, to which the other rejoined, “He knows the ford.” Zi Lu then inquired of Jie Ni, who said to him, “Who are you, sir?” He answered, “I am Zhong You.” “Are you not the disciple of Kong Qiu of Lu?” asked the other. “I am,” replied he, and then Jie Ni said to him, “Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?” With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping. Zi Lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with a sigh, “It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people – with mankind – with whom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state.”</p>



<p>子路从而后，遇丈人，以杖荷蓧。子路问曰：“子见夫子乎？”丈人曰：“四体不勤，五谷不分，孰为夫子？”植其杖而芸，子路拱而立。止子路宿，杀鸡为黍而食之，见其二子焉。明日，子路行以告，子曰：“隐者也。”使子路反见之，至则行矣。子路曰：“不仕无义。长幼之节不可废也，君臣之义如之何其废之？欲洁其身而乱大伦。君子之仕也，行其义也，道之不行已知之矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Zi Lu said to him, “Have you seen my master, sir?” The old man replied, “Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain – who is your master?” With this, he planted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed. Zi Lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him. The old man kept Zi Lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl, prepared millet, and feasted him. He also introduced to him his two sons. Next day, Zi Lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. The Master said, “He is a recluse,” and sent Zi Lu back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old man was gone. Zi Lu then said to the family, “Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that.”</p>

<p>The men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Bo Yi, Shu Qi, Yu Zhong, Yi Yi, Zhu Zhang, Hui of Liu Xia, and Shao Lian. The Master said, “Refusing to surrender their wills, or to submit to any taint in their persons – such, I think, were Bo Yi and Shu Qi. “It may be said of Hui of Liu Xia, and of Shao Lian, that they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their persons, but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be remarked in them. “It may be said of Yu Zhong and Yi Yi, that, while they hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their words; but in their persons, they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, they acted according to the exigency of the times. “I am different from all these. I have no course for which I am predetermined, and no course against which I am predetermined.”</p>

<p>子张曰：“士见危致命，见得思义，祭思敬，丧思哀，其可已矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang said, “The scholar, trained for public duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed.”</p>



<p>子张曰：“执德不弘，信道不笃，焉能为有？焉能为亡？”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang said, “When a man holds fast to virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes in right principles, but without firm sincerity, what account can be made of his existence or non-existence?”</p>



<p>子夏之门人问交于子张，子张曰：“子夏云何？”对曰：“子夏曰：‘可者与之，其不可者拒之。’”子张曰：“异乎吾所闻。君子尊贤而容众，嘉善而矜不能。我之大贤与，于人何所不容？我之不贤与，人将拒我，如之何其拒人也？”</p>



<p>The disciples of Zi Xia asked Zi Zhang about the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse. Zi Zhang asked, “What does Zi Xia say on the subject?” They replied, “Zi Xia says: ‘Associate with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do so.’” Zi Zhang observed, “This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great talents and virtue? – who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue? – men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“虽小道必有可观者焉，致远恐泥，是以君子不为也。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable. Therefore, the superior man does not practice them.”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“日知其所亡，月无忘其所能，可谓好学也已矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn.”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“博学而笃志，切问而近思，仁在其中矣。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, and reflecting with self-application – virtue is in such a course.”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“百工居肆以成其事，君子学以致其道。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“小人之过也必文。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “The mean man is sure to gloss his faults.”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“君子有三变：望之俨然，即之也温，听其言也厉。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided.”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“君子信而后劳其民，未信，则以为厉己也；信而后谏，未信，则以为谤己也。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “The superior man, having obtained their confidence, may then impose labors on his people. If he have not gained their confidence, they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence of his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying him.”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“大德不逾闲，小德出入可也。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small virtues.”</p>



<p>子游曰：“子夏之门人小子，当洒扫应对进退则可矣。抑末也，本之则无，如之何？”子夏闻之，曰：“噫，言游过矣！君子之道，孰先传焉？孰后倦焉？譬诸草木，区以别矣。君子之道焉可诬也？有始有卒者，其惟圣人乎！”</p>



<p>Zi You said, “The disciples and followers of Zi Xia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential. How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?” Zi Xia heard of the remark and said, “Alas! Yan You is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?”</p>



<p>子夏曰：“仕而优则学，学而优则仕。”</p>



<p>Zi Xia said, “The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.”</p>



<p>子游曰：“丧致乎哀而止。”</p>



<p>Zi You said, “Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.”</p>



<p>子游曰：“吾友张也为难能也，然而未仁。”</p>



<p>Zi You said, “My friend Zhang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.”</p>



<p>曾子曰：“堂堂乎张也，难与并为仁矣。”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng said, “How imposing is the manner of Zhang! It is difficult along with him to practice virtue.”</p>



<p>曾子曰：“吾闻诸夫子，人未有自致者也，必也亲丧乎！”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng said, “I heard this from our Master: ‘Men may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.”</p>



<p>曾子曰：“吾闻诸夫子，孟庄子之孝也，其他可能也；其不改父之臣与父之政，是难能也。”</p>



<p>The philosopher Zeng said, “I have heard this from our Master: ‘The filial piety of Meng Zhuang, in other matters, was what other men are competent to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his father’s mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.’”</p>



<p>孟氏使阳肤为士师，问于曾子。曾子曰：“上失其道，民散久矣。如得其情，则哀矜而勿喜！”</p>



<p>The chief of the Meng family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Zeng. Zeng said, “The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorganized, for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.”</p>



<p>子贡曰：“纣之不善，不如是之甚也。是以君子恶居下流，天下之恶皆归焉。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong said, “Zhou’s wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.”</p>



<p>子贡曰：“君子之过也，如日月之食焉。过也，人皆见之；更也，人皆仰之。”</p>



<p>Zi Gong said, “The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes again, and all men look up to him.”</p>



<p>卫公孙朝问于子贡曰：“仲尼焉学？”子贡曰：“文武之道未坠于地，在人。贤者识其大者，不贤者识其小者，莫不有文武之道焉，夫子焉不学？而亦何常师之有？”</p>



<p>Gong Sun Zhao of Wei asked Zi Gong, saying. “From whom did Zhong Ni get his learning?” Zi Gong replied, “The doctrines of Wen and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wen and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular master?”</p>



<p>叔孙武叔语大夫于朝曰：“子贡贤于仲尼。”子服景伯以告子贡，子贡曰：“譬之宫墙，赐之墙也及肩，窥见室家之好；夫子之墙数仞，不得其门而入，不见宗庙之美、百官之富。得其门者或寡矣，夫子之云不亦宜乎！”</p>



<p>Shu Sun Wu Shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying, “Zi Gong is superior to Zhong Ni.” Zi Fu Jing Bo reported the observation to Zi Gong, who said, “Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is valuable in the apartments. The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?”</p>



<p>叔孙武叔毁仲尼，子贡曰：“无以为也，仲尼不可毁也。他人之贤者，丘陵也，犹可逾也；仲尼，日月也，无得而逾焉。人虽欲自绝，其何伤于日月乎？多见其不知量也。”</p>



<p>Shu Sun Wu Shu having spoken revilingly of Zhong Ni, Zi Gong said, “It is of no use doing so. Zhong Ni cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Zhong Ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity.</p>



<p>陈子禽谓子贡曰：“子为恭也，仲尼岂贤于子乎？”子贡曰：“君子一言以为知，一言以为不知，言不可不慎也。夫子之不可及也，犹天之不可阶而升也。夫子之得邦家者，所谓立之斯立，道之斯行，绥之斯来，动之斯和。其生也荣，其死也哀，如之何其可及也？”</p>



<p>Chen Zi Qin, addressing Zi Gong, said, “You are too modest. How can Zhong Ni be said to be superior to you?” Zi Gong said to him, “For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair. Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified the description which has been given of a sage’s rule: he would plant the people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?”</p>

<p>尧曰：“咨！尔舜，天之历数在尔躬，允执其中。四海困穷，天禄永终。”舜亦以命禹。曰：“予小子履，敢用玄牡，敢昭告于皇皇后帝：有罪不敢赦，帝臣不蔽，简在帝心。朕躬有罪，无以万方；万方有罪，罪在朕躬。”周有大赉，善人是富。“虽有周亲，不如仁人。百姓有过，在予一人。”谨权量，审法度，修废官，四方之政行焉。兴灭国，继绝世，举逸民，天下之民归心焉。所重：民、食、丧、祭。宽则得众，信则民任焉，敏则有功，公则说。</p>



<p>Yao said, “Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.” Shun also used the same language in giving charge to You. Tang said, “I, the child Lu, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.” Zhou conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. “Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One man.” He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course. He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him. What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices. By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted.</p>



<p>子张问于孔子曰：“何如斯可以从政矣？”子曰：“尊五美，屏四恶，斯可以从政矣。”子张曰：“何谓五美？”子曰：“君子惠而不费，劳而不怨，欲而不贪，泰而不骄，威而不猛。”子张曰：“何谓惠而不费？”子曰：“因民之所利而利之，斯不亦惠而不费乎？择可劳而劳之，又谁怨？欲仁而得仁，又焉贪？君子无众寡，无小大，无敢慢，斯不亦泰而不骄乎？君子正其衣冠，尊其瞻视，俨然人望而畏之，斯不亦威而不猛乎？”子张曰：“何谓四恶？”子曰：“不教而杀谓之虐；不戒视成谓之暴；慢令致期谓之贼；犹之与人也，出纳之吝谓之有司。”</p>



<p>Zi Zhang asked Confucius, saying, “In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?” The Master replied, “Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things; then may he conduct government properly.” Zi Zhang said, “What are meant by the five excellent things?” The Master said, “When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.” Zi Zhang said, “What is meant by being beneficent without great expenditure?” The Master replied, “When the person in authority makes more beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;– is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect – is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe – is not this to be majestic without being fierce?” Zi Zhang then asked, “What are meant by the four bad things?” The Master said, “To put the people to death without having instructed them – this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning – this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity – this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way – this is called acting the part of a mere official.”</p>



<p>孔子曰：“不知命，无以为君子也；不知礼，无以立也；不知言，无以知人也。”</p>



<p>The Master said, “Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established. Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.”</p>
